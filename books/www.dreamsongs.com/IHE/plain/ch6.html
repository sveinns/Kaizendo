    <h1>6. How To Do Open-Source Development</h1>

    <p>There is no one correct way to run an open-source project.
    Successful open-source projects can be quite different from
    each other. Some, such as Apache, are very democratic and
    volunteers are welcome to participate in all activities.
    Others, such as MySQL, where almost all of the developers work
    for one company, primarily do their development internally and
    then release the results; users and developers engage with each
    other to report bugs, request new features, and generally
    discuss the software, but development happens less visibly.
    There are even some projects that do not have a community at
    all, but consist of just a web page where new versions are made
    available for people to download, and perhaps an email address
    where comments can be sent.</p>

    <p>The more a project encourages conversations and interactions
    among all of its community members, the more benefits it will
    get from using open-source. The key point about open source is
    that the development process must really be open: All the
    developers, both internal and external, need to have the same
    access to the source code and be able to fully participate in
    discussions and decisions about its design. If you currently
    have a geographically dispersed workgroup, then you are already
    probably aware of many of the issues involved. More
    traditional, collocated workgroups will probably need to change
    the way they currently work.</p>

    <p>In this chapter we look at the major activities needed to do
    an open-source project and also discuss the process of creating
    a new release. As we do so, note the new jobs that need to be
    done. To have a successful open-source project requires that
    there be people to do those jobs, so you will need additional
    resources. We also discuss participating in an existing
    open-source project and using an open-source-like process,
    corporate source, within your company.</p>

    <p>One other important point to keep in mind as you read on is
    that although most of the focus in this section is on
    developers, users are also a big part of the process. It is
    important to keep users involved in the process and not treat
    them as second-class citizens.</p>

    <div id="the-infrastructure-needed-for-an-open-source-project">
      <h2>The Infrastructure Needed for an Open-Source Project</h2>

      <p>Every open-source project provides a public code archive
      to access the source code, documentation on both how to use
      and how to modify the code, mailing lists and newsgroups to
      discuss issues, a database to record bugs, and a website to
      provide access to the preceding facilities. These core
      features are the skeleton on which a healthy open-source
      project is built.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="public-code-archive">
      <h2>Public Code Archive</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>A prime requirement for an open-source project is that
        the source code be publicly available.</li>

        <li>Any developer, whether inside or outside the company,
        should be able to get the latest version of the code
        anytime.</li>

        <li>A developer who is in charge of maintaining a
        module--the <em>module owner</em> --should be able to make
        changes directly to the source code.</li>

        <li>Contributions and bug fixes from developers who have
        not yet been granted write-access to the source code need
        to be integrated into the source code archive in a timely
        manner. This can be a major task and will most likely be
        done by the various module owners and other core
        developers.</li>

        <li>Builds of the source code must be done frequently
        (daily where possible) and made available for download by
        developers and users. Usually a less recent build that was
        fairly stable is also kept available for download. Users
        should always be able to download a working version of the
        code.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This is very different from the usual proprietary
      development model where the internal developers have their
      own private copy of the official source code that they
      periodically release to external developers. With everyone
      sharing the same source code archive, when any developer
      fixes a bug or makes a change, it is immediately available to
      all of the other developers; internal developers do not get
      special access. You do not want to discourage potential
      contributors by having them spend time tracking down a bug
      and fixing it, only to find that someone else has already
      done so.</p>

      <p>Most open-source projects use CVS (Concurrent Versioning
      System) to maintain the repository of shared code. CVS
      provides a way for multiple developers to edit the source
      code without stepping on each other's changes. It also
      supports defining branches to create multiple versions of the
      code and makes it possible to roll back to an earlier
      version. CVS is itself an open-source project and is
      available for free.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef"
      id="fnref1" name="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>

      <p>Whatever source control management (SCM) system your
      project uses, it is important that it be freely available to
      your project's developers. Someone working part-time on your
      project will not be willing to spend lots of money to
      purchase a proprietary SCM. Your current development team
      members may believe that whatever proprietary SCM your
      company uses is superior to CVS and that they will have to
      give up useful features if they are forced to switch. They
      need to understand that it is important that everyone uses
      the same SCM system and that the features they lose by using
      CVS will be made up in other ways by working with outside
      developers. It is hoped that the missing features will
      eventually be added either to CVS or to its replacement,
      Subversion. The Subversion project<sup><a href="#fn2" class=
      "footnoteRef" id="fnref2" name="fnref2">2</a></sup> is
      working to build a version control system that will be a
      compelling replacement for CVS in the open-source
      community.</p>

      <p>Bonsai<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"
      name="fnref3">3</a></sup> is a tool used by the Mozilla
      project that lets developers perform queries on the contents
      of a CVS archive to determine recent changes and who was
      responsible for changing a particular line of code.</p>

      <p>One job that must be assigned to a team member is to set
      up and maintain the CVS code server. A second job is to do
      the daily build and make sure it works--and if it doesn't, to
      find out why and to communicate the problem to the relevant
      developers. A third job, already mentioned, is to integrate
      bug fixes and contributions into the source code archive.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="project-documentation">
      <h2>Project Documentation</h2>

      <p>In addition to the normal end-user documentation required
      for any software product, an open-source project needs to
      have good internal documentation for developers. You want to
      make it as easy as possible for new developers to learn their
      way around the source code. The easier it is to learn enough
      to get started, the more developers you'll attract.
      Conversely, if the internal documentation is poor or
      nonexistent, many potential developers will become frustrated
      and give up.</p>

      <p>Those developers who are working on the project as part of
      their normal day job will be prepared to devote whatever time
      is needed to come up to speed on how the code is organized
      and how it works. For them, poor documentation is just
      business as usual, but for people with only a few hours of
      free time in their off-hours who just want to fix an annoying
      bug or make a minor enhancement, the quality of the
      documentation can make the difference between success and
      failure. Initially new developers need to be able to locate
      the relevant locations in the source code and learn enough
      about how that code works to be able to modify it. If they
      are successful, then they are likely to do more work on the
      code. One web-based tool that can help developers search the
      source code is lxr, the Linux Cross-Reference
      tool.<sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"
      name="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>

      <p>This means that all developers who contribute to the
      source code need to be encouraged to document their code.
      Someone also needs to write design documents and keep them
      up-to-date--especially needed is a high-level description of
      the software architecture. This could be an additional job
      for any technical writers that are available on your project.
      Mailing-list archives are also a good place for new (and old)
      developers to learn about various design decisions.</p>

      <p>Another important document is a <em>project road map</em>
      that describes the current development plans for the overall
      project and the individual modules. The road map reflects
      what the core developers and module owners plan to work on
      based on discussions on the community mailing lists. The road
      map allows developers and users to get a sense of what
      changes they can expect and when they might happen. They can
      join in the official work then or, if their particular needs
      are for other changes, they know that they need to organize
      additional efforts. Many developers decide what they will
      work on by consulting the project road map, so it is vital
      that the road map be kept current. The road map, and the
      community discussions about what features are part of it,
      helps to focus your project and give it direction.</p>

      <p>You will also want to create wish lists for the overall
      project and for each individual module. The wish lists are a
      good place for developers to look when they want to find
      something interesting to do that will help the project. The
      process of creating the wish list encourages users to speak
      up and participate in the design. Involving users as
      designers is essential if the project is to be really
      successful.</p>

      <p>Your users will also need documentation. It is likely that
      some of them will be willing to help write it. The public
      user mailing list is an excellent source of information;
      organizing information in it into a list of frequently asked
      questions (FAQ) is a good first step.</p>

      <p>If you have professional technical writers working on your
      project, they will probably be the module owners for the
      documentation. Just as with code, others can send them
      suggestions and corrections, but they are the ones who decide
      what goes into the documentation. Of course, as with a code
      module, a volunteer who makes a number of good suggestions
      can earn the right to edit a document directly.</p>

      <p>Be sure that the documentation you provide is in a format
      that people can easily read such as plain text or HTML. Don't
      require that your users and developers have special software
      to read the documentation--especially software they need to
      pay for! This rule also applies to the software needed to
      create the documentation. A number of open-source projects
      have discussed standardizing on DocBook/XML as the canonical
      format for open-source documentation.<sup><a href="#fn5"
      class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5" name="fnref5">5</a></sup></p>
    </div>

    <div id="bug-database">
      <h2>Bug Database</h2>

      <p>Bugs happen. Being able to keep track of outstanding bugs
      is a must. The bug-tracking tool you choose should be as easy
      as possible for developers to use; otherwise they may not.
      Some developers prefer a bug tool that they can use via email
      so that bug reports are mailed to them and they can reply via
      email. Other developers prefer a web-based bug database.</p>

      <p>Because users are a prime source of bug reports, it should
      to be easy for them to report bugs. Keep in mind that they
      have already suffered by discovering bugs--they may have lost
      their work and undoubtedly lost time--so don't make it
      painful for them to submit bug reports too. It makes sense to
      have a special, easy way for users to report bugs, different
      from the one developers use--it may be necessary for someone
      in the project to then check whether the bug has already been
      reported and, if not, to add it the bug database. Also, the
      more encouragement you can give to users to report bugs well,
      the more testers you will effectively have.</p>

      <p>Another good practice is to have a developer who is
      responsible for reading the user mailing list and filing bug
      reports for problems reported there. It may make sense to
      have a separate mailing list just for bug reports.</p>

      <p>The bug database may also be a good place to keep track of
      suggested enhancements. Any developer should be able to
      record an idea for a future improvement. Module owners should
      make sure that good ideas that come up in the mailing list
      are also recorded. Periodically, the suggestions recorded in
      the bug database should be used to update the wish lists for
      the overall project and for the individual modules.</p>

      <p>An example of a bug-tracking system used by various
      open-source projects is Bugzilla.<sup><a href="#fn6" class=
      "footnoteRef" id="fnref6" name="fnref6">6</a></sup> It was
      originally created for the Mozilla project and the source
      code for it is freely available. The NetBeans open-source
      project is currently using Issuezilla, which is based on
      Bugzilla. Another open-source bug system being developed is
      Scarab.<sup><a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"
      name="fnref7">7</a></sup> The work to maintain the bug
      database is another infrastructure job.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="open-mailing-lists-or-newsgroups">
      <h2>Open Mailing Lists or Newsgroups</h2>

      <p>It is important that all the discussion about an
      open-source project be done in the open. All the users and
      developers should be using a public mailing list or newsgroup
      for their discussions. These discussions include
      announcements, bug reporting, problems and how to solve them,
      design issues, and proposals for future work. Your internal
      developers should also be participating there and not just
      using internal mailing lists. <em>Note:</em> For brevity's
      sake, in the following discussion, when we talk about using a
      public mailing list we also include using a public newsgroup
      or a web-based discussion forum.</p>

      <div id="let-everyone-know-what-is-happening">
        <h3>Let Everyone Know What is Happening</h3>

        <p>It is vital that community members be involved in
        discussions with your internal developers. If it appears
        that your internal developers are doing their work in
        closed internal meetings and exchanges of private email,
        then outside developers will feel like they are being
        treated as second-class citizens and will not participate
        as much as they might. This is not to say that your
        internal developers must communicate only through public
        email lists or newsgroups, but when you have a meeting be
        sure to post notes from it to the list and consider
        inviting outside developers to attend the meeting, either
        in person or over the phone. Also, if you post the agenda
        beforehand, outside developers can express their viewpoints
        via email and these views can be considered at the meeting.
        Note that the more design work done via email, the easier
        it is to preserve it in a mailing list archive; often
        design decisions are never documented and this can create
        problems down the road when the assumptions underlying the
        design change or new people join the project and need to
        understand why certain decisions were made the way they
        were.</p>

        <p>There are other reasons to let everyone know what is
        being considered. It is important to alert the community
        about any plans to make major changes to the code. The
        worst situation is when a module owner makes large changes
        to a module with no notification whatsoever. If other
        developers find out about the change because it breaks
        something they are working on or because when they go to do
        something with the module they find the code totally
        different, then they are not going to be happy. They are
        going to feel that they cannot depend on that module,
        because to them it has changed in an arbitrary manner. It
        is slightly better if the module owner announces that the
        code has been changed; the other developers may be just as
        bad off, but at least they know why sooner. The best thing
        to do is to announce in advance which changes are being
        considered, engage in open discussion with anyone
        concerned, and then announce what has been changed when the
        new code is checked in. Outside developers will feel they
        are part of the process because they really are part of
        it--plus the quality of the design will likely be improved
        because the discussions included more viewpoints.</p>

        <p>On an Apache project mailing list in July 2000 there was
        a heated exchange of messages caused by private
        discussions. Two groups, one from Sun and the other from
        IBM, had each been discussing a particular major component
        primarily among themselves instead of using the public
        email list. When one group announced a new project to redo
        the component's architecture, the other--which had been
        developing that component--basically said "Hey, who are you
        to tell us what to do? That's our code and we'll take care
        of it ourselves, thank you very much." Lots of flames then
        flooded the mailing list. This case eventually had a
        satisfactory resolution, but the upset never needed to
        happen. It turns out that the group members who were
        originally developing the component had concluded in their
        private discussion that it should be redesigned, but that
        they didn't have the manpower internally to do so. Had they
        posted their discussion, they would have gotten lots of
        volunteers and retained their leadership position.
        Meanwhile, the other group of developers had privately
        discussed their problems with the current design, but
        didn't make them public until they announced the new
        project. Had they posted their comments earlier, everyone
        would have come out for a redesign, and they wouldn't have
        created a rift with the original development
        group.<sup><a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"
        name="fnref8">8</a></sup></p>
      </div>

      <div id="posting-etiquette">
        <h3>Posting Etiquette</h3>

        <p>In general, your internal developers have to be more
        careful about what they post than random, outside
        developers do. Even though they may think they are speaking
        as individuals, everyone else will take what they say as
        your company's official policy. If an internal developer
        flames someone, it will not be seen as the action of an
        individual but rather as the action of "one of those
        arrogant guys" at your company. However, it is really
        important that your developers do participate, so you need
        to encourage them to do so. Some folks will never trust
        your company, but they may trust Ken, Yarda, and
        Stefan--employees of your company that the community comes
        to know as individuals.</p>

        <p>As a rule, when sending a reply to a public mailing list
        or newsgroup remember that it will be read by everyone,
        taken out of context, and viewed suspiciously by folks
        trying to determine what your company is up to now. If you
        have a strong emotional feeling when writing the message,
        it might be best not to send it right away; instead, wait a
        day and see how it looks then. Often the first draft will
        let you get any angry feelings out of your system, and the
        second draft is the one that you should actually send.</p>

        <p>One final point about messages: Don't be defensive. If
        someone attacks your company's actions, it is much better
        to wait a bit and see if, as often happens, another
        outsider will come to your company's defense. This will
        carry more weight than if the same message came from an
        employee of your company. Of course, if the original
        message points out an actual mistake that you have made,
        the sooner you admit that it is a mistake and explain how
        you plan to correct it, the better.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="types-and-number-of-mailing-listsnewsgroups">
        <h3>Types and Number of Mailing Lists/Newsgroups</h3>

        <p>Different mailing lists or newsgroups can be used for
        different purposes. A special moderated list for major
        announcements that receives only infrequent posts will be
        subscribed to by many users and developers. An unmoderated
        list with frequent postings on technical issues will have a
        smaller audience. In general, it is better to have too few
        mailing lists than to have too many.</p>

        <p>Which would you prefer: to arrive at a party where the
        first room you see is comfortably filled with people
        talking animatedly, where the host greets you and starts
        introductions, and where groups move into nearby rooms when
        appropriate; or to arrive at a party where some rooms have
        only one or two people doing and saying nothing while the
        rest are empty? Following this analogy, you should strive
        to make your email lists like parties, each with a
        comfortable number of active conversations and an attentive
        host. To start this off, you should try to create one email
        list that is alive with activity, creating new lists only
        as needed. A host has an important job that must be done
        well because it helps set the tone for the community. Part
        of the host's job is to actively discourage flaming in
        order to make the list a safe place for people to post
        to.</p>

        <p>A small project may need only a single mailing list for
        all project-related discussions. For a large, active
        project, each module might have several mailing lists. When
        the number of messages sent out each day grows too large,
        the people on the list might call for splitting it into
        several lists. Before you do so, make sure that it's not
        just a temporary increase in traffic. A single thread that
        lots of folks chime in on can easily double the message
        rate.</p>

        <p>You will need a mailing list for users. Free software
        generally does not have a customer support hotline that
        users can call when they have a problem. They need a
        mailing list or newsgroup where they can post their
        questions. Developers or other users can then post replies
        to help them out.</p>

        <p>It is important to keep an archive of each list. This is
        useful for new developers or new users so they can see if a
        particular issue has already been discussed. It's also
        useful as a group memory. Be sure to make searching the
        archives easy.</p>

        <p>In order to encourage people to answer other folks'
        questions, the Jini team had a policy of waiting 2 days
        before answering a general question. (Those that could be
        answered only by the core team, mostly "why was this done?"
        questions, were answered immediately.) This worked very
        well and has resulted in a mailing list where community
        members naturally answer most posted questions, with the
        core developers answering only the more difficult,
        technical ones.</p>

        <p>Mailing lists and archives serve another purpose:
        dispelling suspicions of an insider cabal. The health of
        any community is likely to become poisoned when its members
        believe that there is a group of people who are secretly
        making the important decisions. This suspicion can sap the
        morale of any organization, and it can happen even if it is
        well known and expected that decisions take place behind
        closed doors.</p>

        <p>In an open-source project, the developers may feel that
        their efforts are being exploited when the project does not
        seem to embrace transparency. One of the best and easiest
        ways to avoid this potential problem is to have an archived
        mailing list (or lists) that has a clear influence on
        decision making.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="spam-concerns">
        <h3>Spam Concerns</h3>

        <p>With the continuing increase in the amount of
        unsolicited and unwanted email messages (spam) that flood
        the Internet, you want to do everything you can to keep
        spam from appearing on your project's mailing lists. If
        only a few spam messages make it through to your mailing
        lists, it's just a minor inconvenience--but if a large
        proportion of the messages are spam, then the mailing lists
        can become useless.</p>

        <p>There are two types of spam to worry about in
        open-source projects: conventional spam which is typically
        advertising sent in bulk and spam email sent by project
        members but inappropriate for the list. An example of the
        second type of spam is a flame war on a topic unrelated to
        the project. Sometimes this can happen when politics or
        world events are mentioned.</p>

        <p>Each project will have a slightly different definition
        of which messages are really spam. Is it okay for a company
        to post a product announcement that relates to the project?
        What about job offers? What about posting the same message
        to several of the project's mailing lists? What about
        continuing to argue after a decision has already been made?
        What about a humorous political cartoon?</p>

        <p>Some open-source projects install spam filters to stop
        conventional spam from infecting their mailing lists.
        Others avoid conventional spam by restricting posts only to
        subscribers. Some allow anyone to post, but if the sender
        is not on an approved list then the message is first sent
        to a moderator. If the moderator confirms that it is a
        valid message, then it is forwarded on to the mailing list
        and the sender is added to the approved list. Sometimes
        messages can be delayed due to the need for moderation
        because it can take hours or even days before the moderator
        gets around to approving the message. Having several
        moderators located in different time zones around the globe
        can help.</p>

        <p>For inappropriate messages, a moderator or other
        community leader can send a private note to the sender
        suggesting either that the email is not appropriate or that
        the email should be sent to individuals rather than to the
        whole list. For companies or individuals advertising
        related products or talking about possible jobs, a
        moderator or community leader should determine how
        appropriate the message is and either notify the sender if
        it's obviously out of line or bring it up with the
        community if it is a close call.</p>

        <p>Whatever spam policy you decide on, be sure to make it
        clear to everyone. People need to have confidence that the
        mailing list software works well. It's generally better
        that a few spams make it through to the list than that
        legitimate messages be classified as spam and dropped. What
        constitutes spam depends on the culture of the community. A
        savvy community designer will post guidelines on the
        community website.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div id="project-website">
      <h2>Project Website</h2>

      <p>In addition to mailing lists, each project needs a website
      where potential users and developers can find out about the
      project and where news about the project can be posted. The
      website should be the portal to all aspects of the project.
      The site can have user guides, tutorials, archives of the
      mailing lists, and other documentation. And of course there
      should be a download page where folks can obtain the latest
      version of both the source code and ready-to-use binaries.
      There may also be pointers to web pages for commercial
      products associated with the project, although the main site
      should not have a strong commercial feel to it.</p>

      <p>When people first hear of your project, the project's
      website is where they will go to find out about it. The
      website will help set their expectations about your project:
      What is the current project status? How can they download
      executables or source code? Does it seem professional? Are
      new developers welcomed? Is it a real community where they
      can fully participate, or is it more like a user group where
      their participation is limited? Is it an active effort or
      does it look dead? Why should they get involved? Is there
      help or tutorials available for beginners? Their experience
      of your project through the website will dictate whether they
      want to get involved as either users or developers, or
      whether they just leave.</p>

      <p>For a small project, the website might be just a few
      pages. For a large project, the site might be quite large,
      with each module having its own set of pages. Maintaining the
      website and making sure the content on it is kept current is
      another infrastructure job that must have a person assigned
      to it. For large projects, an additional person is needed to
      be the editor-in-chief.</p>

      <p>We say more about the project website in the section on
      creating a community of developers.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="software-life-cycle">
      <h2>Software Life Cycle</h2>

      <p>We've looked at some of the infrastructure that supports
      an open-source project. Now let's look at some of the
      activities that need to happen as the project progresses.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="planning-and-decision-making">
      <h2>Planning And Decision Making</h2>

      <p>All of the planning and decision making for an open-source
      project should take place either on the project's public
      mailing lists or at public community meetings. Small groups
      can, and should, get together in private to work up proposals
      and suggestions, but as soon as possible these need to be
      opened for community feedback.</p>

      <p>Public discussion generally takes longer to make a
      decision than a proprietary development group does, but
      because the diversity of the viewpoints is greater for an
      open-source effort the resulting decision is likely to be of
      higher quality. This can translate into a shorter overall
      development cycle, because subsequent work will probably not
      need to be discarded because the <em>real</em> issues came up
      after, rather than during, the discussion period.</p>

      <p>In an open-source project without explicit discussion
      cut-offs, the discussion can sometimes go on for a long time
      with diminishing benefit. In many of these cases, it is
      relatively clear what the sense of the decision is, but
      unless the discussion is cut off at the right time, the
      community will not seem crisp and well run. Therefore, it is
      crucial that someone be sensitive to when the discussion
      seems to be winding down. At that point, it is important to
      post a wrap-up message that summarizes the main issues and
      the consensus on what should be done. Part of the wrap-up is
      to list who has volunteered to actually do the work. Often
      the person who has initiated the discussion is the one to
      wrap things up, but some developers--especially those used to
      working in a hierarchical company--will expect someone else
      to make a decision and tell them what to do, which is not the
      way open-source works.</p>

      <p>One of the most common reasons that a software project
      fails is because it does not meet the needs of its intended
      audience. This is much less likely to occur if the actual
      users of the project can join in the discussions where the
      project's functionality is being defined. For a really
      successful open-source project, it is probably the users that
      started this discussion in the first place. Only after the
      need has been clearly articulated and possible solutions have
      been debated can the developers work on a plan to implement a
      solution. If there are several proposed solutions, then the
      developers may choose to experiment by implementing trial
      versions of each, so that the users can try them all out to
      decide which is the best. Note that this process is called
      user-centered design or evolutionary design and is too seldom
      practiced by proprietary projects; the open-source process
      naturally encourages a user-centered approach.</p>

      <p>Design decisions, and the rationale behind them, need to
      be recorded in the project's design documents. There should
      be a person assigned to keep them up to date. Scheduling
      decisions should be recorded in a project road map document.
      As already mentioned, the road map allows developers and
      users to get a sense of what changes they can expect and when
      they might happen. For a developer looking for a way to help,
      the road map can point them at work that needs to be done. It
      is very important that the road map be kept current; it is
      the definitive source of decision information on the
      project.</p>

      <p>Scheduling takes on a very different flavor for an
      open-source project because many people are volunteers.
      Internal developers can be assigned to tasks based on your
      company's priorities, but outside developers choose what they
      will work on and set their own schedules. We say more later
      about how to do a release, but two points should be mentioned
      here. First, for a typical company-run project, the features
      that will go into the next release are defined, a schedule is
      made up, and the features are then coded. For an open-source
      project this process is reversed: new features are
      implemented, and, when there are a significant number of
      them, a release date is set. Second, setting a release date
      will motivate people who are working on almost finished
      modules to get them done in time for the next release. This
      process of setting a release date and then including in the
      release only those modules that are ready by that date is
      sometimes referred to as the "train model": any modules not
      ready must wait for the next train (that is, the next
      release).</p>

      <p>Reliance on volunteers is another reason that it is
      important to assure that the project uses good modular design
      to enable decentralized development. In his book <em>Open
      Source Development with CVS</em> , Karl Fogel points out that
      "free projects optimize in favor of a distributed burden,
      lessening the vulnerability of the module to any one person's
      schedule (or lapse in judgment for that matter)" (p.
      147).</p>

      <p>In a hybrid open-source project directed by a company, the
      scheduling can have some aspects of company-run projects.
      Remember that in such a project, decisions are still made
      transparently, but the volunteers may agree to defining a
      feature set as the primary determiner of when a release will
      happen, as long as the company developers do that work. In
      this case, other features may still be added, and perhaps the
      release will be delayed for important or interesting
      additional features to be completed.</p>

      <p>Deciding what internal developers focus on is a matter of
      private planning. However, if they are all working on matters
      peripheral to the main community activity, that can be
      bad--project leadership requires that they work to help
      achieve community goals. On the other hand, a company doesn't
      always need to demonstrate leadership. For example, your
      company might join an existing open-source project with the
      sole aim of adding a few features or porting it to another
      platform. But for an open-source project that your company
      initiates, ignoring the wishes of the community can be fatal:
      At best your company will be seen as irrelevant and the
      project will fork, and at worst the community will cease to
      participate and the project will be seen as a public failure
      that only your company cares about. In some cases, a company
      that starts an open-source project is best off ceding
      leadership to the community; cases where this makes sense
      include projects where the company is trying to make inroads
      in open-source-dominated markets or where the experts in the
      area are in the community and not in the company.</p>

      <p>In the end, it's the people who write the code and who
      integrate the contributions who have the final say. The
      phrase "show me the code" often comes up in open-source
      project discussions.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="integrating-contributions">
      <h2>Integrating Contributions</h2>

      <p>In a successful open-source effort, many developers
      contribute bug fixes and new features. Although everyone is
      allowed to read the source code archive, only a small group
      of developers are granted permission to directly modify it.
      In some projects, such as Linux or Mozilla, each module has
      one or more owners--the <em>module owners</em> --who are the
      only ones who can edit the source code for that module.
      Others wanting to make changes must submit their
      contributions to the official module owner, who may or may
      not accept them. Other projects, such as Apache, rely on a
      core group of developers--called <em>committers</em> --that
      jointly oversee the entire project; any one of them can
      modify code in any of the project's modules, although major
      changes are often reviewed and voted on by the entire core
      team. For simplicity, we refer to all the developers who can
      make changes to the official source code as module owners,
      but please keep in mind that some projects do not necessarily
      control access on a module-by-module basis. Also, for smaller
      projects, the original author may act as the project owner
      and be the only person with the right to make any
      changes.</p>

      <p>When a developer who does not have write access to the
      source code submits a bug fix or modification, it is part of
      the job of the appropriate module owner to review the
      contribution and integrate it into the code base if it is
      both well written and in line with the project's goals.
      Accepting a contribution may involve some work, but it is
      fairly straightforward. Rejecting a contribution, however,
      requires some sensitivity.</p>

      <p>Some proposed new features may introduce more
      complications then they are worth or they may be questionable
      in the first place. Module owners need to ensure the quality
      of the code they are responsible for and sometimes need to
      reject a contribution. For the health of the community,
      however, people making contributions should never be made to
      feel rejected. They have donated their time to make a
      contribution, and you want to encourage them to keep working
      on the project. Requesting that they make some changes to
      make their work better is one possible way to do this.
      Another is to reserve an official part of the CVS archive for
      nonstandard contributions; others can see them and
      incorporate them in their builds if they want to. Many
      open-source developers have gone on from receiving
      constructive rejections of their work to become productive
      project members. A healthy community helps to educate and
      develop its members.</p>

      <p>Module owners must also be aware of the attitude of the
      community to their decisions. Module owners are allowed to
      make decisions only as long as they have the community's
      respect. Their authority is largely based on merit. If enough
      other developers disagree with the direction they are taking
      the project, they will either be replaced or the project will
      split into two factions--that is, the code will fork. It can
      become more difficult when a company sponsors an open-source
      project, because initially all the module owners are company
      employees. Module owners then have a manager to answer to in
      addition to the community. Moreover, that manager may or may
      not be responsive to community feedback. For this reason,
      it's important for a company starting an open-source project
      to educate the management chain and to put in place
      performance goals that reflect the success of the community
      and the open-source project.</p>
    </div>

    <div id=
    "how-decisions-get-made-varies-among-open-source-projects">
      <h2>How Decisions Get Made Varies Among Open-Source
      Projects</h2>

      <p>Roles associated with software development include
      architects, designers, implementors (sometimes called
      coders), quality assurance people (or testers), and release
      managers. Some of these roles have to do with managing or
      executing part of the development process (the implementors,
      release managers, and quality assurance people), whereas
      others are thought of as producing or creating important
      artifacts associated with the software (the architects and
      designers).</p>

      <p>In the conventional view of software development, the
      requirements, specifications, architecture, and design are
      formal artifacts produced before implementation, although in
      even the most traditional development projects there is
      iterative refinement of them. In open-source projects, if
      there are similar artifacts, they may be either informal or
      reflected in the source code itself. Open source uses
      continuous (re)design, in which the design and even the
      architecture is fluid based on the use of the software and
      the desires of its developers. Any descriptions of the
      architecture and designs typically reside in discussion
      archives and other peripheral documents as well as in the
      source code itself. Requirements and specifications are
      likewise at best informal, captured in archives, source
      comments, and the source itself.</p>

      <p>The majority of open-source projects have fewer than 20
      developers working on them and rely on a single person,
      usually the originator of the code, to act as a "benevolent
      dictator" making the major decisions. For larger projects,
      decisions are often delegated to the senior developer in
      charge of each code module. Other open-source projects use a
      more democratic method. For example, each Apache Software
      Foundation project has a group of committers who vote on
      changes to the software and on who can become committers.
      Committers can be elected to be Foundation Members.</p>

      <p>We say more on governance in the section <sup><a href=
      "#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9" name=
      "fnref9">9</a></sup> that consists of a farm of machines
      whose sole purpose is to continually check out and build the
      source tree on various platforms and then display the status
      of the builds on a continually updated web page. This lets
      people know when it is safe to check in new changes.</p>

      <p>It is also very important to have the most recent stable
      build available for download. This is for your cutting-edge
      users who want the latest features that have been initially
      tested but have not yet gone through a full release
      cycle.</p>

      <p>To facilitate testing, it is important that the latest
      build (executable) be available for download by the testers.
      You want the smallest delay possible between when a developer
      checks in a fix for a bug and when the testers can download a
      new version containing that bug fix. The faster the feedback
      received the better. In the early days of Linux, Linus
      Torvalds on occasion made several releases of the Linux
      kernel in a single day. That's giving users and developers
      immediate gratification.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="testing">
      <h2>Testing</h2>

      <p>In a very real sense, everyone who uses an open-source
      application is part of the testing effort. The easier you
      make it for users to report a bug, the more likely they are
      to do so. However, the most significant difference between
      user-based testing in an open-source project and traditional
      alpha/beta testing for proprietary software is that, in
      addition to reporting a bug, some developers will isolate or
      track down the cause, and perhaps even submit a fix for the
      bug.</p>

      <p>For some open-source projects, there is no formal testing;
      all the bugs are reported from actual use. For some other
      efforts, testers are recruited as part of the release cycle.
      In some sense, people are volunteering to help test code
      whenever they download the latest build or the last stable
      build. The cutting-edge users and developers are the first
      line of bug finders.</p>

      <p>Looking at the quality of Linux, especially in comparison
      with other PC operating systems, we can see how successful
      this user testing can be. Another example is that the early
      users of Mozilla's 1.0 alpha and beta releases filed about
      1000 bug reports per month.</p>

      <p>Having users do the testing has extra benefits because
      they test not just that the new functionality has been
      correctly implemented but also that the functionality meets
      the users' actual needs. This is combining usability testing
      with QA.</p>

      <p>It's important to thank your testers. Their efforts do not
      get the same visibility as the developers who contribute code
      or folks who write documentation. They should be acknowledged
      somewhere on the project's website and also in a README file
      that is part of the standard distribution.</p>

      <p>For a larger project with more resources, doing some form
      of automatic regression testing can really help make sure old
      bugs do not recur. Jikes, for example, has a regression
      testing framework--which is itself an open-source project,
      called Jacks. Likewise, the Visualization Toolkit project
      uses extensive automated testing. If full-time QA people are
      available to do more formal testing, then so much the
      better.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="releases">
      <h2>Releases</h2>

      <p>Every time someone checks in a change to the source code,
      that is a new release. This is what open-source projects mean
      by continuous releases. For active developers this is great:
      They are guaranteed that they are working on the latest code.
      They won't waste time fixing a bug that someone else has
      already fixed. Other people can start using their
      contributions immediately--and report any bugs they find in
      those contributions.</p>

      <p>But for some users, continuous releases are less
      desirable. Users want some stability in the programs they
      rely on. However, the amount of stability desired varies from
      one user to the next. Some want to be able to use the latest
      features, whereas others want something really solid and
      bug-free. It should be easy for a newcomer who wants to learn
      about your project to locate and download an executable that
      is known to work and has been well tested. This gives
      newcomers something to try out that will provide the best
      initial experience possible.</p>

      <p>To satisfy these conflicting needs, many projects do a
      series of frequent, small incremental releases using code
      that has been mostly debugged, with infrequent major releases
      after the remaining bugs have been discovered and fixed. So
      the more adventurous users become the QA team to flush out
      the bugs in the minor releases.</p>

      <p>When to do a major release is determined by the current
      state of the code: Have a number of serious bugs been fixed?
      Have significant new features been added? Has it been a long
      time since the last release? If the community decides the
      answer is yes, then the project enters a release cycle aimed
      at creating a stable version suitable for release.</p>

      <p>The release process for an open-source project is very
      similar to that used for proprietary products. The main
      difference is that the open-source process is looser. For
      example, if the code for a new module is fairly stable and
      does useful things, then it may be included in a release even
      though the documentation for it is slim or nonexistent.</p>

      <p>A release manager often is needed to coordinate the
      release process. This includes recruiting testers,
      coordinating the testing process, and even making sure that
      the testers are properly acknowledged afterward.</p>

      <p>The release manager's job also includes helping to decide
      what goes into the release and what is not yet ready. This
      generally involves a code freeze, during which new
      functionality is not being added. Once it has been decided to
      do a new release, developers who are in the midst of writing
      new modules will be motivated to finish them quickly so that
      they can be included in the release. Motivating developers is
      good, but finishing the implementation of a module is not
      sufficient; it also must be debugged so that it is stable.
      Part of the release manager's job is to allow only stable
      code into the release. Even some bug fixes may not be
      included if the benefit of fixing the bug is outweighed by
      the possibility of new bugs that may be introduced by the
      fix. The release cycle is not the time to make big changes to
      the code.</p>

      <p>In an open-source project (unlike many proprietary
      projects), ongoing development is likely to continue during
      the release process. Developers may want to continue to work
      on new and experimental modules that will not be included in
      the release. Projects that use a source control system such
      as CVS can start up a branch for the release activity while
      normal development continues on the main trunk. There are
      pros and cons to code freezing versus code branching. When
      code is branched for a release, developers can continue the
      work they're doing that's not related to the release; this
      maximizes ongoing work. But the cost is that any bug fixes
      made to the release version of the code must be merged into
      the main source branch, and changes made to the main branch
      while the release was being done can make such merges
      difficult. When code is frozen while a release is being done,
      developers who want to continue to work on new project code
      can be frustrated when they cannot check in their code and
      test it promptly. Such frustrations can sometimes lead
      developers to abandon the project.</p>

      <p>When most of the known bugs have been fixed and the
      release is becoming stable, it is often a good idea to put
      out a beta release. More people are willing to try out a beta
      version because it has already undergone substantial testing.
      This second batch of testers will help catch the remaining
      bugs.</p>

      <p>Finally, when the last major bugs have been fixed, the
      release is ready to be packaged for distribution and
      announced to the world. It is important that every release be
      given a unique release number so that everyone knows which is
      the newest version and so bugs can be reported against the
      correct version of the source code. Some projects, such as
      Linux, have adopted the convention of giving even version
      numbers to stable releases and odd numbers to untested ones.
      So in October 2002, the latest stable Linux kernel was
      version 2.4.19, the development version was 2.5.44, and the
      beta (prepatch) for the next stable kernel was version
      2.4.20-pre11.</p>

      <p>Companies such as Red Hat make their living packaging the
      major Linux releases and selling them to users who value
      stability, ease of installation, and product support. If your
      company plans on offering a branded product based on the
      open-source code, then it may follow a similar model.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="support">
      <h2>Support</h2>

      <p>The various open-source licenses clearly state that
      open-source software comes with no support whatsoever. This
      is generally discussed as an opportunity for third parties to
      sell support, and indeed companies such as Red Hat make good
      money doing so.</p>

      <p>But the support story is not so clear-cut. In fact, often
      the greatest source of support is from the other users and
      developers working on the project. These are the people who
      care about the software the most and know it the best. In a
      successful open-source project, the main mailing list is used
      by people to ask questions about problems they are having and
      quickly get answers. Some of the answers may not be the best,
      but generally with a little persistence people get the
      information to solve their problems. As long as people
      realize that they are asking for help, rather than demanding
      support, then the mailing list can be a major benefit for
      users of open-source software. But for those users who need
      someone to solve their problems for them, purchasing or
      contracting support from a third party is the way to go.</p>

      <p>This is another way that user feedback can help improve
      the software. Developers get to see the problems real users
      are having and can modify the code accordingly. It's also
      just a small step from asking how to do something to
      suggesting something useful that the program could do.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="adding-a-new-module-or-subproject">
      <h2>Adding A New Module or Subproject</h2>

      <p>Contributing an entirely new module is one of the most
      exciting ways a developer can move an open-source project
      forward. This can add totally new capabilities to the
      software, often taking it in an unforeseen direction. But not
      every proposed new module will be a winner--some will be
      useful only to a small group of users, some will never work
      out, and some will just seem wacky--so it is important for
      the project to have a thorough but flexible approval process
      for new modules.</p>

      <p>Many open-source projects have an experimental area where
      anyone can easily set up a new subproject to develop a new
      module. This provides a sandbox for developers to test new
      ideas and make them available to the community to try out.
      Generally the new module is not included in any of the
      project's official releases, but the developers working on
      the new module can create an experimental version that does
      include it and make it available for anyone who wants to
      download and play with it.</p>

      <p>When the community decides that a new module provides
      important functionality, then it's time to move it out of the
      experimental area and make it an official part of the
      project. This can involve lots of effort, because the
      standards for an experimental module are quite different than
      for an official one. For an experimental module, all that
      matters is that it does something useful or neat, but making
      it "product quality" can require adding user documentation
      (possibly including online help), internationalization
      (I18N<sup><a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"
      name="fnref10">10</a></sup>), localization (L10N),
      accessibility (A11Y), usability testing, a build script to
      add it to the project build process, and a test suite;
      adopting the official project look and feel; and polishing
      whatever rough edges the module currently has.</p>

      <p>That's a lot of work, probably more than the original
      developer originally put into writing and debugging the
      module. Bringing the module up to the project's standards
      requires other developers to help out. That could involve
      employees from your company--UI team, graphics designers,
      technical writers, and QA folks--just as if it were a module
      you had developed.</p>

      <p>There's a potential tension between wanting people to
      innovate by creating new modules and having high standards
      for the official product quality. You need to be careful not
      to make too high a barrier that prevents volunteer
      contributions from becoming part of the official release. One
      way to go about this is to let the community decide what the
      standards are for the open-source project, and then your
      company can choose to do additional work--such as writing
      more complete user documentation or more formal testing--to
      create your own branded version. Just be sure to contribute
      back as much as you can to the open-source effort.</p>

      <p>Finally, it's important to periodically go through the
      list of subprojects and weed out those that are not being
      used and are no longer being worked on. Having too many
      abandoned subprojects makes it more difficult for people to
      find the live ones, and it may make the whole project seem
      dead. Approving subprojects and weeding out the dead ones are
      part of the community coordinator's job.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="making-it-happen">
      <h2>Making It Happen</h2>

      <p>As you can see, lots of work is needed for an open-source
      project to be successful. Here is a list of some of the jobs
      that you must commit resources to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Evangelist/community coordinator to encourage and
        coordinate developers, get publicity for the project,
        increase community involvement, host mailing lists, and in
        general just keep the project moving along. (We say more
        about these activities in the section on creating a
        community of developers.)</li>

        <li>Module owners to be responsible for the development of
        the code and to integrate contributions and bug fixes from
        other developers. They also need to participate on the
        project mailing lists.</li>

        <li>Infrastructure support for the CVS archive, mailing
        lists, bug database, and website.</li>

        <li>Website editor to keep the website alive with new
        content.</li>

        <li>People to document the system architecture and record
        reasons for design decisions.</li>

        <li>Buildmaster to oversee the build process and fix
        problems with broken builds.</li>

        <li>Release manager to coordinate release activities.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Going open-source is not a way to get something for
      nothing. It takes real work to make an open-source project
      successful. But putting in the required effort can yield a
      project that grows much more quickly than if you tried do to
      it all by yourself. For example, a year after Sun started the
      open-source Tomcat project it had 31 developers with commit
      access, only 9 of whom were Sun employees.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="building-a-community">
      <h2>Building a Community</h2>

      <p>Okay. You've announced your project. You really want
      community involvement and participation, not just a user
      group. You've got a website, open mailing lists, a CVS
      archive, and a bug database. Your developers are standing by,
      eager to join in any discussions and ready to accept bug
      fixes and new features. What do you do next?</p>

      <p>You want a healthy community involved with your project.
      This involvement takes many forms. First, you need users,
      people to actually use the software you are creating. John
      Ousterhout, the creator of TCL/TK, has said:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>If an open source software package has a large enough
        number of users (where "large enough" seems to be around
        5,000-10,000), you can be confident that it is functional,
        reliable, and fairly well documented. To see why this is
        true, consider the users. If they are non-expert users,
        there's no way that 5,000-10,000 of them will use a package
        unless it has these properties ( furthermore, the developer
        would go crazy dealing with all of their questions and bug
        reports). On the other hand, if the users are expert and
        there are that many of them, then if there are problems
        they will simply fix them, which they can do since the
        package is open source.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Having a large number of users makes things real and
      applies pressure on the developers. If you don't have users,
      you won't get developers. If you don't have users, then no
      one really cares about your project anyway and it will not be
      successful.</p>

      <p>The distinction between a user and a developer will depend
      on your project. For Netscape's Mozilla browser, there's a
      big difference: Users run the browser; developers write the
      code that is the browser. For a project that is building a
      platform, for example, Java, there is less of a distinction:
      Users write Java programs; developers extend the classes in
      the official Java packages, most of which are themselves
      written as Java code. Someone writing a Java class library is
      somewhere in between.</p>

      <p>In addition to just using software, which is of course the
      whole point of developing it, the users also help in many
      ways. First, they provide support to other users by
      discussing how to best use the software in their work, by
      helping to write product documentation, by answering
      questions posted to the various mailing lists, and by
      marketing the project to potential new users. Second, they
      can contribute any user-level customizations they make to the
      product, such as templates, macros, or preference settings.
      Third, they can help shape the future development of the
      product by suggesting improvements, identifying problem
      areas, and participating in design discussions. Finally, they
      help test the product by reporting the bugs they encounter;
      for most open-source projects, users act as the QA
      department. In all these ways the users become integral to
      the development of the software, unlike their role in a
      typical user group.</p>

      <p>Some of your users will have sufficient technical skills
      to also work on the source code. They may contribute fixes
      for bugs that bother them. Others may get more involved by
      contributing code for a minor improvement or participating in
      design discussions on the mailing lists. Some may join in the
      ongoing work being done by the core developers, possibly
      earning the right to commit code to the CVS repository. A few
      may even become module owners.</p>

      <p>There is a tendency in open-source projects to focus on
      the code, with the result that anyone who is not a developer
      is often treated as a second-class citizen. This is bad
      because the expertise and energy of users is a huge resource
      just waiting to be tapped. It's all too easy to become
      fixated on the source code, on the further development of the
      software itself; however, remember the whole point is to
      create something useful that lots of people will use. Writing
      a good tutorial can have a bigger payoff in attracting more
      new users then adding some spiffy new feature. Identifying a
      subset of your user community that has a common interest and
      creating a new mailing list for them to share ideas with each
      other can bring in lots of new members with a similar
      interest. For example, the OpenOffice project noticed that
      there were substantial numbers of community members who spoke
      languages other than English and so they decided to create
      separate mailing lists for German, French, Spanish, Italian,
      Dutch, and Portuguese native speakers. These native lists
      have been great for building community and have helped to
      attract new members. As of March 2004, there were
      native-language discussion forums in OpenOffice in over two
      dozen languages.</p>

      <p>Keep in mind that your users and outside developers have
      diverse backgrounds. Some may be computer novices, whereas
      others may have more experience than your most senior people.
      Some will have worked on other open-source projects and have
      firm ideas about how they are run; for others your project
      will be their first involvement with open source, and they
      will have only hazy ideas of how to participate and will need
      to be educated in how open source really works.</p>

      <p>As with all online communities, there is a natural
      progression from newbie, to regular member, to leader, to
      knowledgeable elder. The tone of the community you create
      will determine whether people's involvement will grow or not.
      If suggestions to the mailing lists are routinely flamed or
      if code contributions are harshly rejected, people will not
      want to participate. If the community encourages
      participation, even when the contribution is not very good,
      more people will be willing to participate and the level of
      everyone's participation will generally improve over time.
      Many open-source projects report that some of the current
      core developers started out by making somewhat clueless or
      half-baked contributions, but, by receiving encouragement and
      constructive feedback from other community members, they
      improved to the point of becoming key participants.</p>

      <p>You can expect that as the community grows the number of
      people at any given level of participation will be roughly an
      order of magnitude less than the next lower one. For example,
      about a year after the Jini project was started over 40,000
      people had downloaded the Jini source code, but only around
      4000 had subscribed to the Jini-users mailing list. Of those,
      around 400 people were posting occasional messages, with most
      of the posts coming from a core group of around 40, of which
      4 or so were considered elders.</p>

      <p>As your project grows and develops, many decisions will
      need to be made. These will range from those affecting
      individual developers, such as whether a bug fix they have
      submitted is accepted or not, to ones affecting every
      developer and user, such as when to do a major release and
      what features will go into it. How these decisions are made
      and who makes them will either strengthen or undermine your
      project's sense of community.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="whos-in-charge">
      <h2>Who's in Charge?</h2>

      <p>If people feel that they are involved in the
      decision-making process and that their viewpoints are heard
      and respected, then the community will generally accept
      whatever decision is made. If people feel that a decision is
      being rammed down their throats, then they will object and,
      in the worst case, go elsewhere, possibly forking the source
      code and starting a competing project.</p>

      <p>The exact decision-making process varies from one
      open-source project to the next, but in many it is based on
      the idea of a meritocracy: Those who have demonstrated their
      competency through their work on the project are the ones who
      make the decisions. In many cases, the project lead, often
      the originator of the code, has the final say. Likewise,
      module owners make decisions that affect their module. This
      works only as long as the "benevolent dictator" can maintain
      the respect of the developer community; otherwise, the
      community will call for a replacement.</p>

      <p>Note that even in a meritocracy there will be lots of
      politics at play. First, there is the question of who judges
      whether someone has merit or not. There is no objective test
      that prospective contributors must pass. Instead, they must
      somehow prove themselves to the current core group. If their
      approach to the project is sufficiently different from the
      core group's then they may never be judged worthy. Second,
      having a good idea is not enough; it must be presented to the
      community in a clear manner that meshes with the current
      vision for the project. Even though a single module owner may
      make the final decision about whether to incorporate a new
      feature, being able to muster community support in favor of
      the feature can strongly influence the outcome. In both
      cases, there is a tension between the group's ability to
      maintain a narrow enough focus so as to be able to move
      forward and being open to innovation.</p>

      <p>It should also be noted that a meritocracy based on the
      ability to write code has the direct effect of
      disenfranchising users--including users who are qualified
      developers, but who do not have the time or interest to
      contribute code to the project. Giving a say only to those
      who have contributed their time and effort has a certain
      appeal, especially if you are one of those people, but it has
      a negative result if the interests of those contributors are
      different from those of pure users. For example, a
      programmer's needs for a text editor are quite different from
      those of a person writing technical articles. So an
      open-source project developing a new text editor could easily
      put all its energy into adding features that make it easier
      to write computer programs rather than into features such as
      for the needs of footnotes or bibliographies. That's fine if
      the vision of the project is to create an editor for
      programmers, but if the original intent is to provide an
      open-source replacement for proprietary programs such as
      Microsoft Word then the project will be a failure. Success
      requires that all the users have a direct say in setting the
      priorities for the project. Letting everyone vote on which
      bugs are most important to fix is a small example of this. In
      any case, developers get the final vote by deciding what they
      will volunteer their time to work on.</p>

      <p>For an open-source project where the majority, if not all,
      of the senior developers work for a single large company,
      this decision-making process can run into problems. Many
      open-source developers are suspicious of the motives of large
      companies, and they will suspect the senior developers of
      caring more about their company's needs than about the good
      of the open-source project. This makes decision making a
      problem until the outside developers get to know the senior
      developers as individuals and have reason to trust them. Even
      then, people will perceive the situation as potentially
      unfair.</p>

      <p>To counter this, a more democratic process may be
      required. In some open-source projects, the senior developers
      vote on major decisions. For the Apache Software Foundation's
      projects, three positive votes and no negative votes are
      necessary for any decision. Moreover people voting no must
      give an explanation of why they are vetoing the proposal. A
      vote is also required to add a new member to the group of
      voting developers. The Apache HTTP Server Project guidelines
      and voting rules can be found on the Apache
      website.<sup><a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"
      name="fnref11">11</a></sup></p>

      <p>Another solution is to establish a neutral governing board
      that has final say and to which anyone can appeal a decision.
      The Jini, JXTA, and NetBeans projects have done this,
      establishing boards where Sun has only one-third of the total
      votes and the rest of the board consists of well-respected
      community members elected by the community. This has gone a
      long way toward gaining the trust of outside developers by
      showing that Sun cares about the success of the open-source
      project and is not trying to pull a fast one.</p>

      <p>When choosing your company's representatives to such
      governing boards, you need to consider each board's purpose.
      For the Jini project, the board is primarily intended to
      provide technical oversight and so the initial Sun-appointed
      representatives included two of the core Jini architects. For
      the NetBeans project, the board is more of an appeals court
      and so the Sun representative has been someone knowledgeable
      about open source, but not directly involved with NetBeans
      day to day. Such a representative will be more likely to be
      unbiased if any major controversy happens; it also ensures
      that the Sun core NetBeans developers can freely advocate
      their positions without having to stay neutral. If your
      company is involved with other open-source projects, then the
      company employees working on those projects might be
      excellent potential board members for your project.</p>

      <p>The Jini project has gone even further toward democracy by
      putting major decisions to a vote of the entire community. As
      mentioned earlier, Jini technology is a simple distributed
      computing model based on the Java programming language. Among
      other things, it was intended as a model for services--small
      bits of functionality--to discover each other dynamically and
      create a network of interoperating program parts. These
      services could be housed within devices--physically separate
      computing platforms as far as Jini is concerned. Because such
      a model is new, the definition of each service is likely to
      require a maturation period in which an initially immature
      service is defined and released, with perhaps numerous
      improvements subsequently being released. Service definitions
      are specified by Java interfaces (API).</p>

      <p>A problem facing the Jini community was how to maintain
      the consistency and quality of Jini services, where all
      services must conform to the core Jini specifications (it's
      like TCP/IP) but where newly developed services need room to
      experiment and innovate. The community has developed a
      process that is fair, lightweight, and adaptable. It is
      lightweight because most people don't need to use it--they
      just write up specifications for their new Jini services and
      try to get people to use them. Only when they want something
      ratified or when they want to make a change to the core Jini
      services do they need to have the larger community vote.</p>

      <p>To be fair means giving individuals and small companies a
      say equal to that of large companies. It also means
      recognizing that a large company may have many thousands of
      customers using its Jini-based products, and so it deserves a
      greater say than a lone individual. To balance these
      conflicting needs, members are divided into a general house
      and a commercial house. Both houses must approve any proposed
      standard. Acting as a sort of appeals court to oversee the
      process and further ensure fairness is a nine-member
      Technical Oversight Committee (TOC). The initial draft for
      this Jini Community Decision Process (JDP) is described in
      the Jini constitution.<sup><a href="#fn12" class=
      "footnoteRef" id="fnref12" name="fnref12">12</a></sup> The
      current, more detailed version 1.0 of the JDP was completed
      in December 2002.<sup><a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id=
      "fnref13" name="fnref13">13</a></sup></p>

      <p>One final point is that none of the open-source licenses
      tries to describe how the community should be run--if a
      project forks, one branch could vote on everything, whereas
      the other could appoint an individual to make all the major
      decisions. If people do not like the governance structure you
      choose for your project, they may decide to set up a separate
      community with a decision-making process that they find more
      acceptable.</p>

      <p>Likewise, the community has no direct say in changing the
      license--only the copyright owner of the code can do that.
      However community discussions on the project's mailing list
      in favor of changes to the licensing can be effective. The
      Mozilla project is an example; community feedback helped to
      shape the initial license and has also prompted the adoption
      of a dual-license structure. To give the community direct
      say, the copyright could be assigned to a foundation
      responsible to the community with the foundation's governing
      board elected by the members of the community. Then the
      community would have ultimate control over making changes to
      the license.</p>

    <div id="building-trust">
      <h2>Building Trust</h2>

      <p>If you are just a private individual starting up a new
      open-source project, then you might be able to simply
      announce your project and then sit back and wait for
      contributions to start rolling in. For a company, however,
      especially a large company, there's a suspicion that must be
      overcome before outside developers will feel comfortable
      contributing to the project. Basically, you have to earn
      their trust and prove that you do not have hidden motives.
      Further, there is a big difference between creating a
      successful users group and growing a successful open-source
      community.</p>

      <p>If potential developers suspect that you will make money
      by selling the code that they contribute, then they are apt
      to be offended, and rightly so. And if they think that they
      might need to pay you in order to use a product that
      incorporates their contributions, then don't expect to
      receive many contributions.</p>

      <p>You must clearly communicate what your business model is
      and that any money you make is for value that you are adding,
      such as higher-quality or additional proprietary features. If
      you really are profiting from the outside contributions made
      to the project, then even if you can explain how they also
      will benefit, it will be an uphill battle to recruit outside
      developers.</p>

      <p>If developers must pay licensing or royalty fees, they
      will be less likely to contribute back to the project. If the
      license itself is too restrictive or seems to favor your
      company too much, outside participation will suffer. If
      publicity seems to slight contributions from external
      developers, then those developers will create negative press
      and leave.</p>

      <p>The more you actually live a true open-source lifestyle,
      the easier it will be to earn the trust of your outside
      developers. Any incidents where your developers, or other
      people in your company, put a business-as-usual spin on
      things will make it harder for the project to succeed.</p>

      <p>For example, Sun's reputation with the open-source
      community increased with the release of NetBeans under the
      Sun Public License and even more with the release of
      StarOffice under the LGPL and the support of Sun for the
      GNOME project. These overcame some of the bad feelings many
      developers had toward Sun because of the way Sun has retained
      control of Java. However, if any future problems arise
      between Sun and outside developers in the NetBeans or
      OpenOffice projects, the old suspicions may immediately
      resurface and need to be addressed.</p>

      <p>It is vital that your company's developers participate in
      the project's mailing lists. This is how the community will
      come to know who they are and what sort of person each is.
      Remember that trust is built up between individuals. How your
      company's developers interact with community members will set
      the tone for the entire community. Because initially all of
      the module owners will be internal developers, how they
      accept and reject outside contributions will either create an
      atmosphere of real community or convince outsiders that it is
      an effort only by (or for the benefit of) your company.</p>

      <p>You should have qualified outside developers receive
      check-in privileges as soon as possible. So keep an eye out
      for any outside developers who are contributing reasonable
      code; after they have made a few contributions, consider
      granting them CVS commit access. The sooner some module
      owners are outside developers, the better, so welcome anyone
      contributing what could be a new module. These are signals to
      everyone that it is a true open-source project. For example,
      a defining moment for the Tomcat project was the 3.1 Release,
      for which the release manager was from IBM and not from Sun.
      That let everyone know that Tomcat was no longer a Sun-only
      project.</p>

      <p>Because many open-source developers are suspicious of
      large companies, it is important to recognize that it takes
      time to earn their trust and overcome any past mistakes.</p>

      <p>Building trust also applies to people in other parts of
      your own company. When other groups in your company work with
      you through the open-source process, they will understand
      that your project is not business as usual and you will
      probably have a much easier time working with them. You
      should encourage developers outside your work group to
      contribute and when they do, consider granting them CVS
      commit access where appropriate. Note that the process of
      deciding who qualifies for CVS access should be the same
      regardless of whether a developer works for your company or
      outside of it.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="growing-a-community-of-users-and-developers">
      <h2>Growing a Community of Users and Developers</h2>

      <p>You have a basic choice of sitting back and letting
      potential users and developers find you or going out and
      actively trying to recruit new participants. In either case,
      once people start to contribute to your project, you need to
      actively encourage them.</p>

      <p>If you decide to go out and look for folks, then you need
      to know what types of people you are looking for. Who is your
      target audience? Or rather target audiences, because you need
      to grow both the number of active developers and the number
      of people using the resulting software.</p>

      <p>To attract users, you need something that they can use. If
      all you have produced are some major pieces that will go into
      an actual product, then there may not be anything to use yet.
      This was a major problem with the Mozilla project when it
      first started. Without a working Mozilla browser, there were
      no users, and it was much harder to attract developers.</p>

      <p>Once you have a working product, you increase your users
      just as with any other product: You make it better--easier to
      use with more features, better performance, fewer bugs, and
      better documentation. And you market it. Because the source
      code is publicly available, there should be a free version
      that users can easily download and install.</p>

      <p>When you think in terms of starting with a small or
      minimal working useful piece of software, you encourage users
      and other developers to refine the requirements and
      specifications for it. In this way, open source can be very
      like the agile methodologies that produce many small releases
      guided by customer or user feedback.</p>

      <p>A good user mailing list or newsgroup will also help grow
      the number of satisfied users, who will then help future
      novices. It is extremely important early on to help set a
      good tone on the mailing list. By encouraging group
      participation, you help to grow a real community. Out of this
      user community will come your future contributors,
      documentation writers, evangelists, and customers.</p>

      <p>When the project is just starting, having a single
      communal mailing list is best. Resist the temptation to
      overdesign by creating many lists before any community has
      developed. As the volume grows on the mailing list, the
      community itself will decide when it is time to create
      additional lists.</p>

      <p>In a traditional open-source project, people start out as
      users and become more involved because they value the product
      and wish to improve it. Again, your developers need to
      encourage people to participate in the design of new features
      and also in their implementation. For minor contributions,
      this can sometimes be frustrating to experienced developers
      who know that they could do it faster and better by
      themselves, but a few kind words now and then encouraging
      newcomers can really help.</p>

      <p>Another source of contributors is other companies. If a
      company benefits from using an open-source product, then it
      may be willing to devote resources to that project. Actively
      seeking other companies to partner with may be a good
      strategy for growing the pool of contributors. Note that when
      a company gets involved, it may add many new developers who
      are focused on one or two modules. It is important that the
      module owner not be overwhelmed by their participation on the
      mailing lists and can promptly incorporate their contributed
      code and bug fixes. It isn't good if they have to wait weeks
      for their changes to get into the official CVS code archive.
      As soon as possible, some of their more experienced
      developers should be granted check-in privileges.</p>

      <p>When working with teams from other companies, do not
      assume that things are going well just because no one is
      complaining. They might be unhappy but not know who to
      complain to or be unsure of what to expect because they are
      not familiar with open source. It is important that your
      community manager or some senior developer informally contact
      them to ask how they are doing and if they are encountering
      any problems.</p>

      <p>One other source of developers is universities. Providing
      assistance--hardware, software, or funding--to a university
      research program can enlist the aid of large groups of
      students. For example, to promote use of the Eclipse open
      platform for tool integration, IBM announced the Eclipse
      Innovation Grant competition in November 2002 through which
      it would grant a total of $500,000 in awards to university
      faculty members and researchers to use the Eclipse
      open-source code base for teaching or research, or to
      actively promote the growth of Eclipse user communities. IBM
      also has an active Eclipse Fellowship Program to fund
      university-based research in the areas of programming
      languages, tools, and environments.</p>

      <p>Many of these suggestions require your core developers to
      interact with and mentor people outside of your company. This
      can be done only by personal contact. By including community
      work in your open-source developers' performance review
      criteria, you encourage your developers to work with and
      mentor people in the larger community and thereby make the
      project more successful. If they receive the message it's
      important to work with outside developers, but they are
      evaluated only on how much code they've written, then it is
      likely that they will minimize their community participation.
      Without strong outside leadership to pick up the slack, the
      community will then stagnate and the project may become an
      effort done mostly by your company alone.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="give-folks-a-good-initial-experience">
      <h2>Give Folks a Good Initial Experience</h2>

      <p>It is often difficult for a user to download and install a
      new piece of software. This can be due to a variety of
      reasons such as poorly written directions, the number of
      steps required for a successful install, or the difficulty of
      correctly configuring the software to the specific computer
      system. If your project is really compelling to potential
      users, then they will be highly motivated and willing to
      overcome whatever obstacles are in their way. For example,
      the first spreadsheet programs on the early personal
      computers created an urgency in many people, who needed the
      functionality of a spreadsheet so much that they were willing
      to ignore how difficult it was to use them. Of course, if
      your project is that exciting, then it may be that your
      business model should be based on commercial sales and not
      open source.</p>

      <p>It is really important to make sure that people have a
      good initial experience when they locate, download, and try
      out your project's product. Making sure that the initial "out
      of the box" experience is a good one can be the difference
      between a successful project and one with no users. Make sure
      that it is easy for users to locate the correct version of
      the product to download. There should be a link on the
      project's home page that will take them directly to the
      correct download page. It should be crystal clear which
      download is the most recent stable release and which is the
      cutting-edge, buggy release that newcomers may not want. If
      there are known to be major problems with a release, then you
      should have a list of all of the major bugs or missing
      features posted somewhere that users can easily find--in
      fact, they should see the list before they try to download,
      so they can decide if the release is even worth their time to
      try out.</p>

      <p>For most projects, however, the first obstacle people
      encounter may be enough to stop them from going any further.
      If they never hear about your project or can't find the
      project's website, then the project has essentially failed.
      If it's not clear how to download and install the software,
      folks will give up and look elsewhere. If they can't figure
      out how to use the program to do at least something simple or
      if it crashes on them right away, not only are they apt to
      drop it then and there, but they'll also let other people
      know what a loser the program is.</p>

      <p>Any product installation process should be simple and
      straightforward. There should be a clearly written tutorial
      to get people started using the program. After they have had
      a taste of success with it, they will be more willing to put
      up with and overcome problems.</p>

      <p>Trying to guarantee your users a good initial experience
      certainly makes sense as a goal for companies making
      commercial products, but why should an early version of an
      open-source project be so polished? It's certainly true that
      lots of open-source advocates are sophisticated computer
      users and expect early releases from open-source projects to
      be a bit rough. However, they only have so much time to
      devote to trying yours, and overcoming each obstacle eats
      into the time and energy they have available. Too many
      obstacles and they will give up and do something else.
      Remember, they don't need your program--they already make do
      without it and initially are just curious about it.</p>

      <p>In some ways, this is a good situation, because it forces
      you early on to think about how people will actually install
      and use your program, instead of your waiting until the end
      of the development cycle to tackle it, if then. Dealing up
      front with user concerns always makes for a better final
      product.</p>

      <p>Creating a good initial experience also goes for outside
      developers joining your project. What sort of reception do
      they get when they make their first bug reports, contribute
      their first bug fixes, or initially post to the mailing list?
      Are they welcomed or flamed? Does a more senior developer
      mentor them or reject their efforts? Even if their
      contributions are ultimately rejected, it is crucial that
      they feel that their efforts were appreciated and that they,
      as people, were not rejected.</p>

      <p>An example of how to encourage outside contributors
      happened early on in the Jini project. One of the first code
      submissions had major problems. Rather than rejecting it, Ken
      Arnold (the module owner) basically rewrote it. Ken then
      talked privately with the original author about the need for
      the revisions and then announced to the world that the author
      had made this great contribution to the project--without
      mentioning that it had been rewritten. This broke the ice,
      and more outside developers started to contribute.</p>

      <p>Other obstacles that developers face include how difficult
      it is to understand and work with the source code: Is it
      modular? Is there readable system-level documentation of the
      program's architecture and data structures? Is the build
      process straightforward or long and complex? Do they need
      special tools to compile or work on the code? These are all
      potential problems that can make developers decide not to
      devote their free time to working on your project.</p>

      <p>Obstacles can hinder your project in other, more subtle
      ways. During the first few years of the Jini project, lots of
      energy was taken up addressing problems all newcomers seemed
      to face when they first tried to run an example Jini service.
      The problems stemmed from the underlying complexities of how
      the operating system handled multicasting (or not, in the
      case of Windows 2000), the network configuration, having the
      correct security policies set in the Java virtual machine,
      and other such issues that are outside of Jini's control but
      that are needed for Jini to function. Until the Jini project
      included tools to automatically detect these problems and
      then help users track down solutions to them, the beginner
      was faced with a major effort before achieving any success
      with the Jini technology. Some novices make use of the Jini
      FAQ and mailing list archives to solve their problems,
      whereas many more post their plight to the main mailing list.
      Going into its fifth year, the community continues to be
      incredibly supportive of new user problems, but it does take
      up the time of more senior members of the Jini community.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="a-community-website">
      <h2>A Community Website</h2>

      <p>People's first, and possibly only, exposure to your
      project is apt to be through your project's website. People
      working on your project will use the website as a place to
      meet, to post their work, and to find out about the current
      status of the project. The information presented on your
      website and how it is organized can help your project to be
      more successful. A good website helps create a sense of
      community.</p>

      <p>At a minimum your website needs to have pages that do the
      following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Describe your project and its goals.</li>

        <li>Provide access for downloading the most recent
        releases, the latest experimental builds, and the current
        source code.</li>

        <li>Explain how to get involved.</li>

        <li>List recent news items concerning the project.</li>

        <li>Tell how to sign up for the project mailing lists and
        how to search the archive of previous messages.</li>

        <li>List the key developers working on the project and how
        to contact them.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Larger projects will also have web pages for:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Tutorials and examples of how to use your product.</li>

        <li>User documentation.</li>

        <li>Developer documentation, including an up-to-date
        project road map.</li>

        <li>Accessing the files in the CVS archive.</li>

        <li>Reporting, searching, and editing bugs in the bug
        database.</li>

        <li>A list of FAQs about the project.</li>

        <li>Descriptions of each module.</li>

        <li>Pointers to web pages for commercial products
        associated with the project.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Many of these items will be created by your community
      members either directly (for example, someone writing an FAQ)
      or through community activities (for example, an online
      discussion of what milestones are in the project's road map).
      Other pages report on what community members are doing. Some
      projects allow participating developers to create additional
      web pages, possibly giving them personal directories to store
      files in where they can upload their own web pages or
      exchange files with other developers.</p>

      <p>As you can see, the pages on the website must cover a
      large and diverse range of material. This material needs to
      be organized to meet the different needs of the various parts
      of the community. So there may be one section of the website
      dedicated to users and another more focused on developers'
      needs. The project's home page needs to clearly direct
      visitors to the web pages appropriate for their
      interests.</p>

      <p>Moreover, the look and feel of the site will probably
      change as you move from the very public home page to more
      specialized, remote parts of the website. In a home, there is
      an intimacy gradient from the public parts of the house to
      the more private regions visited only by family and close
      friends. Similarly, a website's outer face should usually be
      more polished and standardized, while, further in, individual
      developers may use a variety of designs for the web pages
      that describe their subprojects.</p>

      <p>As the project grows and changes, so too must the website.
      The community itself should be a major source of suggestions
      on how the website can be improved. Make sure it is easy for
      community members to suggest changes to the site and
      participate in its continual redesign. Some of this is easy
      to do by just posting on the web pages an email address for
      suggested changes. That is good mainly for minor corrections
      or adding pointers to web pages on other websites. For more
      substantial changes, it is usually better to have a website
      subproject that volunteers can join.</p>

      <p>There is also a constant need to keep the website fresh.
      New content in the form of articles, status updates, news
      stories, and usage tips must be added regularly. Many people
      do not subscribe to the project mailing lists but rely on the
      project website to keep them up-to-date on things. This point
      came out quite dramatically when the OpenOffice project
      conducted a survey, advertised on all of the major OpenOffice
      community mailing lists and also on the website. When the
      results were analyzed it became clear that over half the
      people who responded did not read any of the mailing lists
      but instead relied solely on the website for news about
      OpenOffice.</p>

      <p>The website is like a newspaper and, if the same old
      articles are there week after week, people stop visiting. One
      important project role is that of website editor. Just as a
      newspaper needs an editor, so does your website. The editor
      needs to solicit articles from developers, gather news
      related to the project, highlight work being done, profile
      key developers, and generally make sure that there is a good
      reason for anyone interested in your project to regularly
      visit your website.</p>

      <p>A large project, such as OpenOffice, NetBeans, and Jini,
      will need its own independent website; it will also have the
      budget to pay for one. Smaller projects can join an existing
      website that hosts open-source projects, such as
      SourceForge,<sup><a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id=
      "fnref14" name="fnref14">14</a></sup> Java.net,<sup><a href=
      "#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15" name=
      "fnref15">15</a></sup> or the Free Software Foundation's
      Savannah.<sup><a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id=
      "fnref16" name="fnref16">16</a></sup> If a company has many
      small projects, it may make sense to gather them together on
      the same website. For example, Sun has a website for smaller
      Sun open-source projects called SunSource.net<sup><a href=
      "#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17" name=
      "fnref17">17</a></sup> and IBM has a similar
      site.<sup><a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"
      name="fnref18">18</a></sup> Appendix A contains URLs for
      other companies' websites.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="meetings">
      <h2>Meetings</h2>

      <p>Mailing lists, websites, and other flavors of online
      communications are good, but to have a real community it is
      important for community members to actually meet each other
      in person. Being able to put a face with a name and to really
      interact with people--hearing their voices, seeing their
      facial expressions--is what is needed to create a true sense
      of community. Meeting in person also helps you to see people
      as individuals and to break down the barriers between
      companies.</p>

      <p>Community meetings help the project to develop its own
      culture, which reinforces the community by helping to define
      a group identity and building stronger bonds between members.
      Each community will have its own flavor based on its shared
      values, its philosophy, the personalities of major members,
      and other unique properties. Attending a community meeting
      gives members a shared experience. It helps to create a
      larger context by exposing people to aspects of the project
      that they would otherwise not have seen.</p>

      <p>Meetings are excellent places to do the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Discuss and vote on major issues--sometimes it is much
        easier and quicker to reach consensus when meeting in
        person.</li>

        <li>Have individuals or subgroups present their work to the
        larger community.</li>

        <li>Conduct demonstrations of new products or
        subprojects.</li>

        <li>Connect developers and users.</li>

        <li>Start up a new subproject--people can more easily share
        their enthusiasm in person than through email.</li>

        <li>Acknowledge people who have contributed to the
        project.</li>

        <li>Perform informal market research and test out new
        ideas.</li>

        <li>Generate excitement for the project.</li>

        <li>Create a greater sense of community.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>So it is very important that your project schedule regular
      community meetings. These can be full events in themselves or
      just a part of some larger event--the NetBeans community has
      scheduled meetings as part of the JavaOne conference and also
      at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention. Meetings can involve
      the entire community or just members of a subproject. If your
      project has working groups, committees, or a governing board
      that can be scheduled as part of a larger projectwide
      meeting, that will make it easier for individuals to justify
      traveling to participate in them.</p>

      <p>Consider using formats other than the typical presentation
      and panel sessions. One idea is to have a <em>fishbowl
      discussion</em> . For a fishbowl, place five chairs in a
      circle in the middle of the room with the audience arranged
      around them. The session starts with four of the chairs
      occupied--usually with key project members--and one empty.
      The rule is that conversation can continue as long as at
      least one of the chairs is unoccupied--as soon as all five
      are occupied, the conversation must halt until someone gets
      up and leaves. The people initially in the four chairs start
      a discussion on some matter of importance to the community.
      Only the people sitting in the central chairs may speak.
      Someone in the audience who wants to say something must come
      up and sit in the empty chair, at which point one of the
      other people in the circle must leave (usually someone who
      has already spoken). The resulting discussion often has a
      more thoughtful tone than in other formats, partly because
      each person gets only a few chances to speak and so wants to
      make the most of each opportunity, and partly because the
      discussion is not dominated by back-and-forth discussions
      among a few people. At the Jini Community meetings, it has
      become something of a tradition to end the meeting with a
      fishbowl discussion about issues facing the community and the
      future of Jini technology.</p>

      <p>Make sure to leave time for informal activities so people
      can meet up with folks with similar interests. Avoid the urge
      to schedule every minute. Encourage people to hang out
      together by having a reception with good food and drink. Have
      a group outing to some local landmark. Eat meals together.
      Make sure that your meeting space has places for people to
      sit together and talk. Sometimes the most valuable
      discussions happen outside the official sessions.</p>

    <div id="corporate-source-issues">
      <h2>Corporate Source Issues</h2>

      <p>Engaging a community can be more difficult in a
      corporate-source project than in an open-source project. This
      has to do with the nature of identity in the two arenas.
      People working for a company sometimes have a special
      corporate identity. By this we mean that employees adjust
      their behavior and attitudes to align themselves better with
      the corporate culture. For example, an employee might display
      more loyalty to the company while in the workplace than may
      be natural for that employee at home or at a ball game. But a
      commons-based project requires candor and a critical eye from
      participants in order to realize the benefits of the slowly
      dawning insights that commons-based approaches encourage. In
      an open-source setting, identity is a pseudonym because it
      may not be easy to find out someone's true identity behind
      the email address or people may not be inclined to look hard
      for that real identity. But in a company, it's easy to find
      out who is behind each email address and one's candid
      comments might figure into performance reviews and other
      employment decisions. This fear of exhibiting beliefs and
      behavior that would be good for a corporate source project
      but which might be considered contrary to the rah-rah culture
      of the company might inhibit employees and limit the
      effectiveness of the project.</p>

      <p>Moreover, some developers are afraid of exposing their
      weaknesses--such as poor language skills--to an audience that
      could include managers who can fire them or withhold
      projects, raises, and promotions. When the context is a
      judgmental company project, some potential contributors might
      fear to expose a weakness that is otherwise not apparent. In
      an open-source project, in contrast, language skills do help
      a contributor, but there is generally tolerance for people
      who are not speaking their native language or who happen to
      be less skilled at writing than others in the project.
      Although the day-to-day dealings in open-source and corporate
      projects can be equally difficult and judgmental, corporate
      projects additionally brim with employment-related dangers.
      Whereas open-source projects thrive on candor, bottom-up
      action, and merit-based advancement, corporations may
      encourage strict team play, command-and-control, and
      hierarchy.</p>

      <p>Sometimes experts are hesitant to expose their expertise
      because that might jeopardize their competitive advantage in
      the company. This hesitancy could boil down to a desire to
      get credit for contributions--in some cases people are more
      comfortable with disclosing information when there are audit
      trails that reveal who is accessing their disclosed
      information.</p>

      <p>Project leaders and other managers advance by taking
      responsibility for a tough project and then delivering. But
      to some this can appear hard to do when control is
      relinquished to others, which is what happens when other
      people in the company, who do not report to the project
      leader or manager, are granted the right to check in or have
      write access to source code. And so project leaders and
      managers may not accept a corporate source project or may do
      so only reluctantly and therefore try to limit broad
      participation, at least unconsciously.</p>

      <p>These are all impediments to building a strong community
      for a corporate source project. For corporate source to be
      truly effective, there needs to be a corporate culture that
      respects and celebrates speaking honestly.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="three-principles-for-community-building">
      <h2>Three Principles for Community Building</h2>

      <p>We end this section with three basic community design
      principles from Amy Jo Kim's book <em>Community Building on
      the Web</em> (pp. xv-xvi). We highly recommend this book,
      which describes the strategies needed to create a thriving
      online community.</p>

      <p>First, design for growth and change. Don't overdesign your
      project up front. Start off small and focused. Grow in
      response to the needs of your community members. This echoes
      the development philosophy of open source: Start with a small
      but useful working version of the software and permit the
      community to continuously (re)design it. The poet, William
      Stafford, in speaking of writing, has provided a good
      definition of art:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>[Art] is a reckless encounter with whatever comes
        along.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Building a community is an art.</p>

      <p>Second, create and maintain feedback loops. You need to
      listen to your community in order to meet its needs. No one
      likes to be just a cog in someone else's machine. Doing this
      is harder than it sounds. Try to find someone to direct the
      evolution of the community part of your open-source project
      who is not heavily invested in the technology under
      development. Such an outsider is likely to care about the
      community more than the technology and therefore will be able
      to listen better.</p>

      <p>Third, empower your community members over time. As your
      project "grows and matures, your members can and should play
      a progressively larger role in building and maintaining" the
      project. A common failure of the meritocracy is that the old
      guard hang on too long. Some elders develop a fear that only
      they know the true path for the software and that permitting
      someone else--anyone else--to have a definitive say will blow
      it. You should encourage your leaders to move on earlier
      rather than later. The following quotation is from an
      interview with a short-term participant in open source:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>There's another [open-source] project whose technology I
        use and I want to develop further, but the "benevolent
        dictator" is simply a dictator ... the few developers who
        stick around are like that too ... who needs
        that?"<sup><a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"
        name="fnref19">19</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Taken together, these three principles will help you to
      nurture and guide the excitement and energy of your users and
      developers to grow a successful project with an engaged
      community. The results will be much more than you could have
      done by yourself.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="ending-an-open-source-project">
      <h2>Ending an Open-Source Project</h2>

      <p>Open-source projects have a natural life cycle. They may
      start out slowly and then have a long period of growth when
      many new features are added and bugs fixed. Eventually, they
      can mature and go into a maintenance phase when people still
      use the software, but no further major development is done.
      As your project matures and you achieve your main business
      goals for it, you may want to reallocate resources to other
      efforts. Also, a change in your company's situation might
      force a decrease in its level of involvement. It is natural
      for the founder of an open-source project to leave in order
      to move on to other interests. However, this does not
      necessarily mean just abandoning the project.</p>

      <p>Right from the start of your project, you need to make it
      a practice to encourage community members to increase their
      participation. You should recruit active outside developers
      into the core team, giving them as much responsibility as
      they will take on. Each module owner should identify another
      developer who can take over as the new maintainer for the
      module if need be. For example, each module in Mozilla has an
      owner and one or more <em>peers</em> who can also approve
      code for check-in into the module; a peer is an obvious
      choice for replacing the current module owner. Involving
      outside developers in the running of your project early on is
      healthy for your project and creates a pool of people that
      you can turn the project over to should you need to.If your
      company decides to reduce or end its involvement in an
      open-source project, there are certain steps you need to take
      in order to assure a smooth transition and to avoid creating
      bad feelings toward your company. This is all very similar to
      how your company handles the end of life of its products in
      order not to antagonize its customers. Your company probably
      has a special process to approve ending a product. It should
      have a similar approval process for ending or decreasing
      participation in an open-source project that it has
      sponsored.</p>

      <p>As soon as the possibility that the company may need to
      decrease its level of involvement with the project arises,
      you need to plan out how to disengage. In your internal
      discussions, you may need to remind your managers and others
      that the company must not abruptly end its involvement--they
      need to understand that it will probably take several months
      to ramp down and turn the project over to the community.</p>

      <p>It is important that you announce your company's
      intentions to your community as soon as possible. You want
      them to hear it from you, not through rumors or an article in
      the press. Remember that what you do here may hurt the
      company's reputation, making it harder to sponsor or
      participate in other open-source projects in the future.</p>

      <p>If your company is currently paying for your project's
      website and it plans to stop doing so, then you need to work
      with your community to find a new home for it. Possibly one
      of your community members might be able to take over the
      hosting of it, or you may need to make use of one of the free
      open-source hosting services, such as SourceForge. You should
      help migrate over all of the website contents, CVS trees, bug
      databases, email archives, and other community documents. Be
      sure that the source code does not disappear when your
      company stops its support because your company may have a
      legal obligation to make sure the source code continues to be
      available for some specified time period. For example, the
      GPL requires the source code to be available for 3 years
      after the last release was distributed.</p>

      <p>You need to decide the level of future involvement your
      company wishes to have with the project, if any. This
      includes whether you want to encourage your developers to
      continue working on it as part of their jobs or on their own
      time if they so choose. For example, will you permit your
      developers to take time to answer questions about the source
      code that only they may be able to answer?</p>

      <p>How your company ends its involvement will leave a lasting
      impression. By doing things right, your company will be
      remembered for generously contributing its efforts to make
      the project a success. If your company just abandons the
      project, then it will be thought of as a company that doesn't
      care about open source and that is not a good partner.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="joining-an-existing-open-source-project">
      <h2>Joining an Existing Open-Source Project</h2>

      <p>So far we have been discussing open-source projects that
      your company starts and provides the leadership for. If your
      work can build on an open-source project that already exists,
      then your needs are apt to be better met by joining that
      project and not by trying to start a new effort. You would
      definitely want to join an existing open-source project if
      your goal is just to port an open-source application to a new
      computer platform or to add a new feature to an existing
      open-source application or library.</p>

      <p>Joining an already established open-source project is much
      easier than starting your own project because someone has
      already set up the infrastructure (website, CVS code archive,
      mailing lists, and bug database) and a community of
      developers is already working on it. Thus you can focus your
      efforts on adding the new functionality you need.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="license-issues">
      <h2>License Issues</h2>

      <p>Before joining an open-source project you need to check
      that its licenses are compatible with your business goals.
      For example, suppose that you are planning to combine the
      existing open-source code with proprietary code. If the
      project is using a GPL-style license then you will not be
      able to do so. However, if it is using any of the other
      common open-source licenses, including LGPL, then you will be
      okay.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="becoming-a-good-community-member">
      <h2>Becoming a Good Community Member</h2>

      <p>In theory, your involvement can be as limited as merely
      contributing a few bug fixes or small new features.
      Generally, your business goals will require you to do a bit
      more, and you will need to actively participate in the
      project and establish yourself as a valued community
      member.</p>

      <p>Each open-source project has its own flavor, just as each
      Internet newsgroup or mailing list does. People are known to
      the community by their previous posts and contributions. It
      is very important that, before you start posting to the
      project mailing lists, you first lurk for a bit. Read over
      some of the mailing list archives to get a feel for how the
      project operates: Who is influential, what are the current
      major issues, and how are issues decided? You should also
      search the archives to see what has already been discussed
      about your particular areas of interest.</p>

      <p>When you first post to the project to announce how you
      want to be involved, it is very important that you
      acknowledge the good work already done and explain how you
      plan to add value. You want to avoid appearing arrogant. You
      may also need to alleviate people's fears that your company
      is somehow trying to rip them off--sometimes just explaining
      why it is important to your company is enough to do that.</p>

      <p>Keep in mind that you need to establish your reputation as
      an individual working on the open-source project. Other
      people working on the project don't care so much about your
      position at your company. What they care about is the quality
      of your posts and code contributions. The more they respect
      you, the easier it will be to work with them.</p>

      <p>This might be a good place to mention some reasons why you
      should contribute any modifications you make back to the
      open-source project. First, it's the right thing to do. The
      community has made the code available to you, so you should
      return the favor by giving it any improvements that you make
      to the code. Second, it will help you build better relations
      with the community. If you are perceived as a good community
      member, then you are more apt to be listened to in
      discussions about the project's future. Finally, if you do
      not contribute your changes, then with each new release of
      the software you need to manually add your changes to the
      latest version of the source code--if the code has changed in
      ways that are incompatible with your modifications, you may
      need to do significant work to reincorporate your changes.
      When you give your changes back to the community, people who
      make additional changes will do whatever work is necessary to
      keep your code from breaking. By not contributing your
      changes, with each release you will need to do that work; you
      will be paying what is often called the stupidity tax.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="the-open-source-development-process">
      <h2>The Open-Source Development Process</h2>

      <p>The key to open-source development is that it is an open
      process. This is especially to your benefit when joining an
      existing open-source project. By looking at the project's
      website, you should be able to learn everything you need to
      know about how the project is organized. In particular, you
      can read the project road map to get an understanding of what
      development is planned. You can identify the individuals
      responsible for the modules you will be working on. You can
      read the mailing list archives to get a sense of the
      project's history and character.</p>

      <p>As you begin to work on the project, you need to make sure
      that you maintain this openness. Make sure that you use the
      project's public mailing lists and not a list internal to
      your company. Involve the community in any major design
      decisions that you need to make.</p>

      <p>Being open in your intentions is quite important in your
      dealings with the project's module owners. These are the
      people who have the final say as to whether your proposed
      contributions are accepted into the official code base. That
      being the case, it is important that you post a message
      announcing your intentions--what you want to do and how you
      plan to do it--before doing any major work. This will give
      the module owner and the other developers a chance to comment
      on your plans and evaluate how they fit in, or do not fit in,
      with the community's development plans. It is likely that you
      will need to make your work more general or extend the
      functionality to satisfy the rest of the project. It is also
      likely that the revised plan will be better overall. Note
      that if all you want to do is implement an API to your own
      proprietary code, that will not get much, if any, community
      support.</p>

      <p>Some of the discussion may become a bit heated; many
      developers express themselves quite bluntly. Don't let the
      flames get to you. Remember that many of the people you are
      dealing with are volunteers and some may be quite
      inexperienced. Your replies should be aimed at the community
      and not at the "idiot" who just flamed you. Refer to the
      earlier section on "Posting Etiquette" for more on how to
      handle yourself when posting.</p>

      <p>For more details of the day-to-day mechanics of an
      open-source project, please see the earlier section "How to
      Do Open-Source Development."</p>
    </div>

    <div id="getting-your-contributions-accepted">
      <h2>Getting Your Contributions Accepted</h2>

      <p>To be effective when doing open-source development, it is
      very important to create realistic expectations on both
      sides. We have already talked about making sure that the
      community, and especially the module owners, have a clear
      expectation of what you want to contribute to the project.
      This will greatly increase the chances that your code will be
      accepted when you finish it. Another factor in your favor is
      that most people running an open-source project want their
      application to become popular and be used everywhere, so if
      your company is interested in modifying it a bit so it will
      be of interest to more people, you already have a leg up.</p>

      <p>It is also important that you have realistic expectations
      about how the open-source project functions. For example, it
      may release a major stable version once a year, so if it has
      just finished a release cycle, then anything you contribute
      won't be officially released until the next year's major
      stable version. Likewise, if the project is in the middle of
      a release cycle, there may not be much community interest in
      discussing the wonderful new features that you are planning
      on--you may need to wait until the release is done before
      people have the energy to discuss major new features.</p>

      <p>Another potential problem you face is that the particular
      module owner you are working with may be very slow in
      accepting your contributions. This may be because the module
      owner is busy with other matters or doesn't have much time to
      devote to the project. It may also be that your team of
      several developers is writing code much faster than the
      single module owner can digest it. If this is the case, you
      need to gain the trust of the module owner so that you can be
      allowed to check code in directly. It helps if you respect
      the coding style already used in the module when you write
      bug fixes, patches, or small changes.</p>

      <p>A major role of the module owner is to guarantee the
      quality of the code base by screening contributed code. Some
      module owners are happy to share this screening function with
      developers who have shown that they are competent. Although
      module owners have the last word on what goes into their
      module, they are fine about letting delegated individuals
      check in the code when it is ready, as long as the general
      design had been discussed on the project's mailing list
      beforehand.</p>

      <p>Sometimes, however a module owner refuses to delegate, and
      this can create a major problem. Some module owners insist on
      understanding every line of code in their modules, which is
      fine for small modules but may be impossible for a very large
      one. This is especially true for some original project owners
      who have never been willing to delegate responsibility to the
      various modules but instead insist on being a bottleneck that
      all major changes need to go through. If this turns out to be
      the case and the module/project owner is unwilling to change,
      you may need to muster community support for sharing
      responsibility. Otherwise, your only option is to fork the
      project. That is what happened with Emacs back in 1992: The
      XEmacs project came about when Lucid Inc., tried to
      contribute major changes to the display code and Richard
      Stallman refused to accept them.<sup><a href="#fn20" class=
      "footnoteRef" id="fnref20" name="fnref20">20</a></sup> A
      decade later, the two projects still remain
      separate.<sup><a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id=
      "fnref21" name="fnref21">21</a></sup></p>

      <p>A successful example of a company joining an existing
      open-source project is IBM's work on the Linux operating
      system. In an interview on Slashdot, the IBM Linux Kernel
      hackers talked about getting their changes accepted into the
      Linux code base:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Question: Is Linus accepting your changes well? How
        directly do you submit patches, and what are your
        experiences on the overall Linux kernel development
        style?</p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Answer: Linus himself is wonderful about accepting
        patches on technical merit alone. He doesn't "grade" them
        differently if they come from ibm.com or mit.edu. We submit
        patches the exact same way that everyone else does: append
        the patch, mail to Linus and CC linux-kernel. If it's good,
        it gets in. If it sucks, you get flamed.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>However, the submission process can be more complicated
        than first appears. Often, you need to figure out who is
        maintaining a particular area of code, followed by talking
        to them to gauge if someone else is already working on the
        same thing. Once you submit your code to them and the
        appropriate list (isn't always lkml ...), you may not get a
        response. This can be discouraging, but you have to find
        out why, or just simply resubmit, over and over and over.
        But, once you have a reputation, it does get easier to get
        quicker responses.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Sometimes it's frustrating when you've put a lot of
        effort into something that doesn't get accepted, but
        there's normally a good reason for it. Even work that
        doesn't get accepted can influence other people's thinking
        and development in the future. On the flip side you can
        also just point out problems and other people fix them for
        you, so in general you win more than you lose;-)

      <h2>Open Source within a Company</h2>

      <p>Everything mentioned so far about running an open-source
      project or joining an existing one also applies to corporate
      source, where all of the users and contributors are employees
      of your company. What changes when everything is done within
      a company is that the potential audience is much smaller, and
      depending on the company's culture, it may be more difficult
      to communicate and work with other participants.</p>

      <p>In the normal world of open source, people working on a
      project come together because of their common interest in the
      project and generally do not have other connections between
      them. Sometimes volunteers might be in competing companies
      and that might influence their working relationship, but by
      and large everyone acts as individuals, albeit with their own
      personal technological biases.</p>

      <p>Inside a company, however, there can be substantial
      barriers to cooperation and a tendency to use the official
      hierarchy of the company to force both how decisions are made
      and what developers will work on. This is very much at odds
      with the idea of creating a community-based project. When you
      are working within your company, there can be lots of
      pressure to do things the standard company way. In a
      company-sponsored open-source project, you can fight against
      this kind of pressure by pointing out the bad press that
      would ensue, but this tactic does not apply to internal
      projects.</p>

      <p>This highlights the need to have strong executive
      sponsorship for corporate source projects. Without it, the
      time employees spend working on corporate source projects
      will often be questioned by their managers, and in hard times
      resources for the project will be the first to be cut. This
      is a typical problem--the work is good for the company as a
      whole but is not a priority for any specific department. It
      can take lots of nurturing to get a company's culture to
      embrace the cross-company cooperation needed for corporate
      source to be successful.</p>

      <p>To justify a corporate source project, it helps to be able
      to point to successes within the company due to using the
      tools developed by the project. The crudest way to do this is
      just to measure how many times the tools have been
      downloaded. That gives some measure of interest in the
      project and can be useful for potential users--it highlights
      what others have found useful in the past. Another measure is
      to look at the number of people contributing to the project
      and the parts of the company they are in.</p>

      <p>The normal wisdom is to try to minimize any barriers
      between an open-source project and a potential user. So we
      advise not requiring users to register in order to download.
      However, for their corporate source effort HP does require
      employees to register in order to download a tool. This,
      then, provides information on where in the company a tool is
      being used and enables HP to follow-up to see how it is being
      used. Part of the follow-up is an email message to the author
      or authors of the tool. This provides the authors with
      evidence of the use of their contributions, which can be used
      during performance reviews; it also provides an incentive for
      the authors to contribute more by improving the tool or
      contributing others. Thus, in this case, what would otherwise
      be a barrier is actually an enabler.</p>

      <p>One of the major problems faced by efforts to encourage
      software reuse is making developers aware of existing code.
      Likewise, for corporate source, if customer engineers do not
      know that there's a great tool that a corporate source
      project has developed, they will never use it. It is vital to
      make sure that when good tools are developed that this be
      advertised across the company to all those employees who
      might benefit from it. This requires communication between
      parts of the company that traditionally do not interact much.
      It also calls for communication at the grassroots level
      rather than through the normal organizational channels.
      Messages from executive sponsors can help to make the
      corporate source projects more visible.</p>

      <p>At HP Labs, the code repository was handed over to the
      corporate librarian, who organized it for easier search and
      retrieval. This constant attention to the contents of the
      repository for the purpose of making it easier to retrieve
      made a significant difference in the use and usefulness of
      the repository.</p>

      <p>This is part of a common thread for the use of open
      source. The source code is produced by developers, who have,
      in general, the mindset of an engineer. Engineers are good at
      looking at a complex situation, understanding it, and then
      either repairing it or designing something that helps make it
      better. That is, they are good at puzzling things out. For
      many engineers working on an open-source project, once the
      code is done, everything is done. Perhaps this attitude comes
      from the belief that other people are like engineers and that
      therefore anyone should be able to figure out the rest. For
      example, engineers are sometimes poor writers because they
      believe that once the sentences are more or less on the page,
      the meaning can be puzzled out.</p>

      <p>Therefore, we recommend that, for the documentation, the
      website, building the community, organizing meetings, and
      anything else that is not engineering the source code, you
      find people who are good at those things and who value them.
      The developers will appreciate it--perhaps without knowing
      why.</p>

      <h2>How to Do Open-Source Development</h2>

      <p>Doing open-source requires transparency and openness, and
      this extends to you, too. If art is a reckless encounter with
      whatever comes along, so is a successful open-source project.
      You need to give up some control and be willing to accept the
      direction the community takes the project because that is
      likely to be the direction where success lies.</p>
