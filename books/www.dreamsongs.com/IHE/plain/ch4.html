    <h1>4. Why Consider Open Source?</h1>

    <p>An open-source project works best when everyone involved
    derives some benefit from it. There must be a good reason for a
    person or group to make its work available and for other
    people--users, developers, and other interested parties--to
    want to participate.</p>

    <p>One very compelling reason for you to participate in an
    existing open-source project is if your work can build on it.
    By joining the project, you avoid needing to redo large amounts
    of work. Plus, there is an existing community of users and
    developers who have an interest in what you are adding to their
    project. An example of this was Sun's contribution of its Java
    Server Pages technology to the Apache web-server project to
    create the Jakarta project.<sup><a href="#fn1" class=
    "footnoteRef" id="fnref1" name="fnref1">1</a></sup> By doing
    this, Sun assured that JSP would become available on the most
    widely used web server, that the Apache developers would not
    create a competitor to JSP, that it would be easier to work
    with other companies such as IBM on JSP technology, and that
    JSP could build on the work already done for Apache. For the
    Apache community, adding JSP was a way to add desired
    functionality and expand the community of Apache developers; it
    was also a vote of confidence in their work with Apache.</p>

    <p>There are many reasons for people to participate in an
    open-source project. These include the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The software being developed helps them to do their work
      better.</li>

      <li>They can influence development.</li>

      <li>They can modify the code to suit their needs.</li>

      <li>They can interact with and learn from other users.</li>

      <li>They can be part of a cool project.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These are also reasons why you might choose to join an
    existing open-source project.</p>

    <div id=
    "business-reasons-for-choosing-to-open-source-your-code">
      <h2>Business Reasons for Choosing to Open Source Your
      Code</h2>

      <p>Deciding to manage a development project as an open-source
      project requires making a careful determination of the
      project's business goals--an open-source project is generally
      more expensive to operate than a proprietary project, and
      there are different scheduling and development processes that
      need to be adopted and that can affect product delivery.</p>

      <p>The following is a list of business reasons to support the
      use of open source for a project. To illustrate them, we
      provide concrete examples based on our experiences with
      various Sun-sponsored projects such as NetBeans, OpenOffice,
      Project JXTA, Java.net, and Jini.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="visibility">
      <h2>Visibility</h2>

      <p>When a project is run using open source, the existence and
      nature of the project are visible to the outside world and to
      people in other parts of your company. If the project is
      visible to a strategically important community--whether it
      participates in the project or not--your company is better
      able to present plans, goals, features, and statements of
      progress. Open source makes available additional
      communication channels, including more informal ones
      consulted by the target developer community.</p>

      <p>For example, any sort of open, Java-related activity, such
      as the NetBeans project, enables the Sun developers working
      on it to use the various Java newsgroups as well as Slashdot
      and other weblogs to communicate directly with other
      developers. Although this is a good way to get feedback from
      the community about technical matters, it is not suited to
      marketing hype.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="training-and-education">
      <h2>Training and Education</h2>

      <p>The best way to learn design and implementation skills is
      to read and study good designs and source code. This teaching
      method is rarely used in software development and engineering
      curricula, so it's often up to companies to do on-the-job
      training. Whether the open-source project is internal or
      external, it can supply source code, design documents (or at
      least archives of design discussions), and provide
      opportunities to try out ideas and talk to designers and
      implementors.</p>

      <p>In general, this is an advantage with transparency. For
      example, creative writing, music, art, sculpture, and most
      engineering disciplines use publicly visible artifacts to
      educate practitioners. Apprenticeships are a classic form of
      observational education. In some older crafts, an apprentice
      would do menial tasks such as cleanup and setup for months or
      years before actually being instructed and helping with the
      real work, and this was educational because the apprentice
      could observe the craftsperson at work, which would help him
      or her know what practicing the craft was all about.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="ubiquity">
      <h2>Ubiquity</h2>

      <p>By providing an open-source offering, a project can begin
      to spread that offering first to the outside users and
      developers of the project, then out to the broader
      open-source community, and then perhaps to the larger
      developer community. Both the no-cost and open nature of the
      offering and the transparent stance of the project to the
      users of the offering contribute to the spread of the
      offering. The transparent stance conveys the message that
      your company's developers don't consider themselves the
      ultimate authority on the offering and not only value the
      contributions of the community but consider other members of
      the community as equals.</p>

      <p>For example, an explicit goal of NetBeans was to create a
      common IDE platform that would be one of the three most
      popular Java development environments. This is a ubiquity
      goal. Jini is another example of a project that has attempted
      to establish a new, ubiquitous platform for services. Eclipse
      is also directed at ubiquity.</p>

      <p>Another example is StarOffice, for which ubiquity includes
      creating a large and diverse user base. A person might go to
      OpenOffice.org to download the latest version, but then stay
      to participate in the mailing-list discussions of how to best
      use the OpenOffice application and how it might be improved.
      Because of the feeling of community that arises from being
      part of those discussions, the person is much more likely to
      recommend OpenOffice to others; and a user becomes a
      community member.</p>

      <p>Ubiquity helps a company engage in service businesses.
      With Eclipse, IBM is creating a plug-in platform that its
      professional services business can leverage, and similarly
      GE's involvement with the Visualization Toolkit enables them
      to have more convincing and substantial engagements, both
      inside and outside the company.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="design-discipline">
      <h2>Design Discipline</h2>

      <p>Doing development open-source style requires making almost
      all decisions on mailing lists open to the public. Design and
      implementation proposals are made in writing and discussed by
      the community, and the resulting decisions are summarized in
      writing. All this written material is archived and available
      to everyone. By enforcing this level of discipline, the
      quality of the design and implementation decisions is likely
      to increase--simply because they are being done deliberately
      and in writing. The process of writing it all down creates a
      need to express issues in a clear way, which often forces you
      to better understand matters. This better understanding then
      leads to a better design. In many ways, the open-source
      process resembles the literate programming methods promoted
      over the years by computer scientists such as Donald
      Knuth.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="best-standards-development">
      <h2>Best Standards Development</h2>

      <p>Some projects have as a goal developing a standard--API
      definitions, language extensions, or tool extensions. Opening
      up the process to everyone makes it more likely to get the
      best advice and achieve the greatest adoption.</p>

      <p>The best and first example of this is the Common
      Lisp<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2" name=
      "fnref2">2</a></sup> community, which was created precisely
      to do standards development. Initially, the goal was a de
      facto standard embodied in a particular book (<em>Common Lisp
      the Language,</em> by Guy L. Steele Jr.) and a set of
      informal agreements, but after the artificial intelligence
      industry and the Department of Defense embraced the language,
      it became the subject of ANSI standardization.</p>

      <p>The NetBeans IDE APIs had been designed in an open way to
      begin with, so an open-source approach simply maintained this
      practice. A goal for OpenOffice was to create an XML standard
      for file formats.</p>

      <p>In general, it appears that a standardization effort that
      is based on an open-source or commons-based community is less
      likely to suffer from the worst of politics. Open-source and
      commons-based communities almost always have at least a hint
      of meritocracy built in, where status and influence are based
      on achievements within the community rather than on the
      strength or influence of the organization that the individual
      represents. Further, the decision-making conversations in
      such a community are much more likely to center around
      technical and engineering issues than around business and
      marketing issues.</p>

      <p>For example, the Jini Community is partially organized
      around a standards-granting body. Because the community is
      made up of both individuals and companies, its organization
      has two "houses," one in which each individual has one vote
      and the other in which each company has one vote. Any
      proposed standard must be approved by both houses to be
      adopted by this community. The discussions in this community
      about proposed standards indeed revolve around the
      technology, and the community has been quite successful at
      getting companies to work together that traditionally have
      had a lot of trouble doing so. We believe it is important
      that the sponsoring company, Sun Microsystems, rarely has a
      significant stake directly in the application area and
      thereby can act as an unbiased helper in the
      discussions--Sun's stake is in the underlying infrastructure
      that Jini provides, which is provided at no cost.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="conversations">
      <h2>Conversations</h2>

      <p>A technology company can thrive when it engages in
      conversations with its customers and potential customers.
      Such conversations largely take place between a salesperson
      and a technical customer, but relationships between technical
      staffs are important.</p>

      <p>Open source is a way to engage a broad group of
      people--fans and foes alike. Some of the conversations are
      about design and implementation issues directly associated
      with the source code, but there are many other, indirect
      opportunities for a company to learn.</p>

      <p>It is relatively rare for an outsider to be interested in
      helping a company with its proprietary products, and
      frequently outsiders are not in a position to know enough
      about a company's strategy and dynamics to offer useful
      advice. But, by listening carefully to the corners of the
      conversations with outsiders in an open forum such as an
      open-source project, a company can learn quite a bit that
      could impact new products and product directions.</p>

      <p>By listening to people talking about the challenges and
      problems they face--particularly with the technology of the
      open-source project--a company can figure out what new
      products or directions would help with those problems. When
      participants talk about how they use some other technology in
      conjunction with the technology being developed by the
      open-source project, a company might make plans to integrate
      this other technology or make it easier to work with by
      creating or extending the infrastructure. This is not the
      same as just doing what the customer says because the
      customer might not know or care enough about the technology
      behind the solution--it's seeing the problems and trends that
      matter. The listening company needs to think and problem
      solve carefully to come up with a good solution.</p>

      <p>Such conversations sometimes are more natural face to
      face. A sponsoring company can arrange for a community
      meeting or other event where members of the community are
      given an opportunity to talk about their projects and work.
      The wise company will send someone hopelessly curious to find
      out all about the problems and exciting opportunities facing
      community members and thereby arrange to bring back valuable
      ideas for new products.</p>

      <p>Naturally, conversations such as these can forge
      relationships between companies, such relationships being
      less likely in the more adversarial and isolated world of
      business. By letting people talk to people, companies can
      talk to companies.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="design-help">
      <h2>Design Help</h2>

      <p>By opening up the design process to the community, a
      project can get not only advice on direction but help on how
      to design the implementation for that direction. This can
      come in the form of what is generally considered design, as
      well as direction regarding features and usability from pure
      users. We call users who provide good directions and even
      pure design <em>user/designers.</em></p>

      <p>Most developers don't distinguish between development and
      design, so by aiming for development help, many open-source
      projects expect design help as well. Getting design help was
      an important goal for the Jini project, because for Jini
      success meant defining Jini services for printing and
      consumer appliances that fall outside of Sun's areas of
      expertise. Community feedback on the benefits of using
      NetBeans, not just as an IDE but also as an application
      run-time platform, resulted in adding a new direction to the
      NetBeans project. Now NetBeans also supports developers who
      wish to create applications on top of the NetBeans core
      framework. This new focus on NetBeans as a platform has also
      helped to improve the NetBeans IDE.</p>

      <p>Of all the business reasons given here, design help may be
      the most important. Many software products fail because they
      do not meet the needs of their intended users. An article in
      <em>Scientific American</em> by W. Wyatt Gibbs ("Software's
      Chronic Crisis," September 1994) stated that "some three
      quarters of all large systems are <em>operating failures</em>
      that either do not function as intended or are not used at
      all." Indeed, the 1994 <em>CHAOS Report</em> by the Standish
      Group stated that over 30% of software projects are canceled,
      with the greatest risk factor being lack of user involvement.
      User feedback, coupled with the open-source practice of
      incremental development and frequent releases, helps keep a
      project in touch with reality and focused on what is most
      important. Feedback from users includes answering the
      question of whether the project is even worth doing at
      all.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="guidance-for-proprietary-products">
      <h2>Guidance for Proprietary Products</h2>

      <p>Some open-source licenses permit proprietary products to
      be based on an open-source system, sometimes by adding
      features and sometimes by providing quality and support. The
      ability to develop the best such product can be improved by
      commentary and feedback from the community.</p>

      <p>Apple's Darwin open-source project, of course, forms the
      basis for OS X--it is the underlying operating system on top
      of which the nice Finder-based look-and-feel is
      implemented.</p>

      <p>Guidance for proprietary products was a major goal for
      NetBeans, with the Forte for Java Internet and Enterprise
      Editions being for-sale products built on the NetBeans
      platform. (<em>Note:</em> Forte for Java has been renamed Sun
      Java Studio.)</p>
    </div>

    <div id="build-a-market-for-a-proprietary-product">
      <h2>Build a Market for a Proprietary Product</h2>

      <p>When a company has a proprietary product built on top of a
      free, open-source version, the free version will bring in
      customers and increase the company's market share. Users of
      the free version can be persuaded to upgrade to the for-sale
      version to get new features, better support, training, or
      consulting services. It also makes it more difficult for
      competitors to enter the market because they will need to
      compete with a free product.</p>

      <p>Rather than having their proprietary product possibly
      compete with their open-source version, some companies make
      them one and the same. However, new features may appear first
      in the proprietary version and make their way into a later
      release of the open-source version only after a delay of
      several months. Customers who want the latest features are
      often willing to pay for the proprietary version rather than
      wait for them to be added to the free version. This approach
      was pioneered by Aladdin Enterprises for GhostScript,
      probably the world's most widely used second-source
      PostScript and PDF interpreter, and has also been used by
      TurboLinux.</p>

      <p>Another approach is to release the software as open
      source--using a license such as the GPL that requires that
      any larger work based on the open-source code also be made
      open source--and then license the software to any companies
      that wish to use it in a proprietary product. This is what
      Trolltech AS does with its Qt multiplatform application
      development framework, which is the basis of the open-source
      KDE graphical desktop for Linux. It is also the strategy used
      by both MySQL AB and Sleepycat Software for their database
      products.</p>

      <p>Being able to sell or license a proprietary product based
      on an open-source code base requires that a company own the
      copyright to all the source code and be doing most of the
      development of the code. You should expect only minimal
      contributions from outside developers, who are generally not
      eager to have a company profit from their work.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="development-help">
      <h2>Development Help</h2>

      <p>One of the myths of open source is that an open-source
      project will attract a lot of developers, and therefore the
      costs of operating a project using open source will be lower
      than using proprietary processes. This isn't
      true<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3" name=
      "fnref3">3</a></sup> primarily because most software is still
      largely monolithic or made of modules that are too large and
      so most volunteer developers do not have the time or
      motivation to fully understand the code well enough to want
      or be able to add significantly to it. However, finding bugs,
      fixing some bugs, and porting software to other platforms or
      making it work in new configurations are the sort of help a
      project can reasonably hope to get.</p>

      <p>If the code for your project is relatively modular and
      doesn't require weeks of study in order to be modified, then
      you can expect outside developers to contribute code for new
      features and even entire new modules. But note that these
      contributions will probably not be for features you had
      planned on for the next release. Instead they will be
      whatever the individual outside developers need for their
      work. Such contributions may appeal to many other community
      members, broadening the project's scope.</p>

      <p>NetBeans is structured as a set of modules communicating
      through APIs. One goal was to create a community of module
      developers, which has happened: Outside developers have
      indeed contributed new modules and continue to work on them.
      Similarly, the OpenOffice community has been effective in
      improving its huge code base by adding new modules for spell
      checking and printing, helping port OpenOffice to Linux,
      working on a port to Mac OS X, and localizing it to more than
      two dozen languages.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="internal-open-source-and-reuse">
      <h2>Internal Open Source and Reuse</h2>

      <p>A company can use an open-source methodology within its
      walls for a variety of internal benefits. By organizing
      development around the commons, the entire organization can
      be informed about which projects exist, how the project is
      doing, and who is working on it. Sometimes people can make
      quick but significant contributions. And sometimes the
      organization can make use of intermediate releases and
      participate in quality control. For companies that do alpha
      and beta testing, such internal releases can help find and
      fix problems before--rather instead of--releasing them
      outside the company.</p>

      <p>Detailed internal information such as this can benefit
      sales, marketing, and sales engineering by providing ways of
      finding out information without (over)burdening
      development.</p>

      <p>But most important, doing internal open source opens up
      the possibility of reuse. By reuse we don't mean the planned
      <em>use</em> of libraries and frameworks but the unexpected
      and serendipitous reuse similar to what happens when you
      visit the junkyard or scrapheap. There may be pieces of code
      not designed to be used in multiple contexts that can
      cannibalized or used in unexpected ways, and an open-source
      or commons-based development approach can provide visibility
      into projects, thereby encouraging such reuse.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="support-help">
      <h2>Support Help</h2>

      <p>One of the hallmarks of a good open-source project is that
      community members provide support to each other. More
      experienced developers and users help out folks with less
      knowledge, and practically everyone answers the questions
      posted by beginners. Community members assemble and edit
      lists of <em>frequently asked questions</em> (FAQs) and post
      them to the project's website. Some folks may even write
      tutorials and articles to help others get started. All of
      this community support activity is work that you do not need
      to provide resources to do.</p>

      <p>For the Jini project, Sun's top developers participate on
      the public mailing lists. This has attracted lots of
      experienced outside developers to these lists because they
      know both that they can get their advanced questions answered
      there and also that they can benefit from seeing the answers
      to other people's questions. Because of the community feeling
      that has been created, these outside developers are then
      willing to answer the less difficult questions, freeing up
      the Sun core team to do other work.</p>

      <p>But keep in mind this is not a way to get something for
      nothing. There must be a reason for knowledgeable folks to
      want to visit your project's website and participate in
      discussions. One of the best reasons is that you have one or
      more employees participating who are even more experienced
      and who can answer the more difficult questions that are
      posted to the project's mailing lists. This could be some of
      your senior developers, or someone slightly less experienced
      who can refer the question to the appropriate senior
      developer. It should not be a junior person because community
      members will quickly perceive this and feel that you consider
      them second-class citizens.</p>

      <p>Although Jini is mostly a community of developers, this
      sharing of support also works with users, as can be seen on
      OpenOffice.org. The OpenOffice community has written
      <em>How-to</em> guides giving step-by-step instructions on
      how to do specific tasks with OpenOffice, has put together
      lists of FAQs, and has created sample and template files that
      demonstrate OpenOffice's capabilities and how to accomplish
      certain tasks. This help has been made available in many
      languages including Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German,
      Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. The website also has a
      general users' mailing list--plus native language mailing
      lists in over two dozen languages--where anyone with a
      problem can post questions that others in the community will
      answer.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="facilitate-technology-transfer">
      <h2>Facilitate Technology Transfer</h2>

      <p>When you are introducing a new technology and trying to
      spread it to other developers, creating an open-source
      project can help. The project provides an attractive place
      for people to come to learn the new technology by doing
      things with it and seeing what others are doing with it. The
      people that originated the technology are available to answer
      questions and to steer further development based on community
      feedback.</p>

      <p>The Jini project is an example of how a gated-community
      effort can help to introduce many new developers to a
      technology. Having Sun's core Jini team working with outside
      developers that were trying to learn about Jini created a
      vibrant Jini community that continues to flourish and to help
      introduce Jini technology to new developers.</p>

      <p>This is very different from creating a user group for a
      technology. User groups tend to be places for novices to go
      to download tutorials and white papers, to read FAQs, and to
      ask their questions. Aside from the occasional online chat
      session, there is no sense of discussing issues with the team
      developing the technology. As a result, as soon as developers
      start to master the technology they tend to drift away.</p>

      <p>Using corporate source can facilitate technology transfer
      within your company. When ongoing research is both visible
      and accessible through an internal open-source effort,
      developers in other parts of your company can learn about and
      experiment with new technologies and better relate them to
      your products and marketplace. Just encouraging more
      communication between researchers and the rest of your
      company can be a win. Both HP Labs and Sun Labs have internal
      open-source efforts to help them to move new technologies
      into the rest of the company.</p>

    <div id="limited-resources">
      <h2>Limited Resources</h2>

      <p>Sometimes you just may not have enough resources to do all
      the work that's needed on your own. We've pointed out several
      times that you can't expect volunteer help to pick up the
      slack, but there are several other open-source-related
      options that might work for you.</p>

      <p>The simplest is building on top of an existing open-source
      project. If the work you want to do adds value to the work
      already done by the project and fits in with its vision, then
      the community will welcome your contributions. Depending on
      the project's license and philosophy, you might be able to
      create a for-sale product if that is important to your
      business model.</p>

      <p>Sun took this route when deciding how to improve the
      desktop shipped with Solaris. Rather than investing the
      effort in upgrading its proprietary Common Desktop
      Environment (CDE), it made more sense to switch to GNOME and
      focus Sun's resources on improving certain aspects of GNOME
      such as accessibility, integration with Java, and
      documentation--all areas where the GNOME community welcomed
      additional participation.</p>

      <p>If there is no existing project you can join, then
      creating a new open-source project or a gated community might
      work, provided that you can recruit other companies and
      individuals that share your vision and are willing to work to
      realize it. An open-source project may provide a better
      framework than trying to set up a more formal consortium. The
      way Java is developed is an example of this strategy: Through
      the Java Community Process, new extensions to Java are
      jointly developed by participating companies that write the
      necessary specifications, reference implementations, and
      technology compatibility kits.</p>

      <p>You can also use corporate source to pool the efforts of
      developers and engineers throughout your company that have
      common needs. For example, within Sun various teams in
      different parts of the company each needed to develop an
      internal tool to monitor service requests (trouble tickets)
      and report various statistics about them. A team in France
      developed a client-server version of the tool, which they
      then shared with another team in Germany that had been
      looking into writing a similar one. The German team had to
      rewrite part of the tool to work in their particular
      environment, but that was much easier than starting from
      scratch. Moreover, their revised version improved on the
      server component and the French team was able to adopt their
      changes. Meanwhile, other teams in the United Kingdom and
      Sweden have joined in the effort and are working on other
      improvements. Each team now has a better tool with less
      effort on its part then if it had developed it alone.</p>

      <p>Note that all of these options are quite different from
      putting out a half-done project and hoping someone will come
      along to help finish it.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="improved-quality">
      <h2>Improved Quality</h2>

      <p>When releases are made available to users early in the
      development process, bugs are more likely to be caught. When
      the source code is made available to developers outside the
      core team, those bugs can be located and fixed. The outside
      developers can also add many of the small features that the
      core team wants but doesn't have time to get to--making the
      product more usable. This all results in greatly improved
      quality in the official release. Moreover, the bugs that
      bother users the most are the ones that are actually most apt
      to be fixed.</p>

      <p>For example, sendmail is the Internet mail program used in
      the majority of email systems worldwide. Eric Allman,
      sendmail's original author and now CTO of Sendmail Inc.,
      which offers a commercial version based on the open-source
      version, had the following to say on how open source improves
      product quality:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Another thing I've learned big time is that there is no
        QA department better than the Internet itself. Nobody can
        afford to simulate the Internet QA lab. By having the open
        source support, we get this incredible base of people that
        are willing to be on the bleeding edge, and give great
        feedback.<sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id=
        "fnref4" name="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Perhaps the Visualization Toolkit people would dispute
      this by claiming that adding automated testing to an
      open-source project achieves an even higher level of
      quality.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="time-to-market">
      <h2>Time To Market</h2>

      <p>For open source, there is a time-to-market advantage, but
      it is a more complicated notion than simply getting a product
      into a space quickly. By using available open-source code in
      a project, a company is able to avoid re-inventing it. This
      can speed up getting to market, but the more important effect
      is that a company can get to a very good product quickly,
      especially one with a greater number of already proven
      features and better quality. That is, the right product is
      achieved faster. If existing open-source code is available,
      this could also mean getting a product into the new market
      space ahead of the competition. If such code isn't available
      and the idea is to start an open-source project to design and
      implement a new product, then the company will not get a
      product out faster than by going it alone, but the initial
      open-source-based product will probably be a better product
      than one done with proprietary methodologies. Tellis and
      Golder argue this is likely a better strategy than simply
      being first (see the section <sup><a href="#fn5" class=
      "footnoteRef" id="fnref5" name="fnref5">5</a></sup> which was
      created primarily as a community site but also as a sort of
      central open-source hosting site for Java-related projects--a
      kind of SourceForge for Java. However, not only were the
      usual open-source tools provided, but social software tools
      such as wikis and weblogs were added. The website has a
      newspaper feel, and there is a site editor, akin to a
      newspaper's editor-in-chief. The goal is to bring together
      open-source developers in the hopes that a marketplace might
      develop.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="avoiding-lock-in">
      <h2>Avoiding Lock-In</h2>

      <p>A common strategy for companies is to offer a high-value
      product and create brand lock-in--making it hard to move to
      another product--by providing special platform-specific
      capabilities. An open-source community will not tolerate
      proprietary lock-in and will generally move toward making the
      offering as portable as possible.</p>

      <p>This was a major goal for NetBeans, where the competitors
      to NetBeans and Forte for Java were seen as promoting lock-in
      not only to their own IDEs but perhaps also to particular
      Java implementations.</p>

      <p>This could be a goal for Eclipse, as well. IBM is
      concerned with the dominance of Microsoft in the software
      development and server markets, and Eclipse certainly could
      be aimed at providing a popular, open-source alternative to
      Microsoft's proprietary products in this area.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="risk-reduction">
      <h2>Risk Reduction</h2>

      <p>Of concern to many companies is the risk they face if a
      software product they depend on is discontinued. With
      open-source applications, they know they can continue product
      development even if the original developers stop working on
      it. In the past, the primary way of reducing the risk that a
      producer would abandon software or go out of business was a
      practice called <em>software escrow</em> wherein the source
      code was held by a third party as if in a vault whose
      contents were to be released to the consumer of the software
      upon certain contractually defined events.</p>

      <p>The risk that a software product might stop being
      supported can be acute when the product is offered by a small
      company. Customers are often wary of buying a product from a
      small company because the company might go out of business.
      By making the product open source, a small company can assure
      customers that even if the company disappears the software
      will still survive. Rather than making its money from
      software sales, the small company would instead need to sell
      support, training, and/or consulting services.</p>

      <p>Making an application open source also reduces the risk
      for the company that initially developed it. For example,
      Cisco Systems decided to release their Cisco Enterprise Print
      System software (CEPS) under an open-source license partly to
      reduce its dependency on in-house programming staff. Cisco
      wanted to make sure that if the original programmers left the
      company, the software would continue to be maintained. In
      fact, one of the two original developers did eventually take
      a new job elsewhere, but, because it is an open-source
      project, he has been able to continue to work on it. If a
      developer really identifies with a project, then you can
      ensure that person's participation for a long time by making
      it open source.</p>

      <p>Another way that a company reduces its own risk by making
      a product open source is that the outside developers who work
      on the project become attractive candidates to hire: They are
      knowledgeable about the product and have a proven track
      record. There are numerous examples where a major contributor
      is later hired by the company that started the open-source
      project.</p>

    <div id=
    "appeal-to-the-community-whose-name-is-the-open-source-community">
    <h2>Appeal to the Community Whose Name Is "The Open-Source
    Community"</h2>

      <p>Some open-source pundits and leaders talk about "the
      open-source community" as if it were a clearly identifiable
      set of people. Some even speak as if this community were
      homogeneous and universal, making statements such as "the
      open-source community rejects" some company-sponsored
      project. This happened to the Jini project when it first
      appeared.</p>

      <p>Jini was one of the first forays by a large company into
      commons-based software development. (Other small companies,
      such as Lucid, Inc., in the 1980s, worked on open-source
      software as part of their product strategies.) Jini was
      released under a gated-community license called the Sun
      Community Source License (SCSL), and Sun termed this sort of
      license a "community source" license, both to distinguish it
      from open-source licenses and to ensure that there would be
      no confusion between the two types of development
      communities. Some of the open-source leaders denounced Sun
      for hijacking the concept of open source, for confusing the
      public by introducing a new name, and for introducing a new
      model. Further, some of these leaders stated to the press
      that open-source developers were not interested in community
      source and did not participate in the Jini community.
      Actually, there were quite a few open-source developers in
      the Jini community at that time and still are.</p>

      <p>Since then, the early leaders of the "open-source
      community" have grown to accept community source and other
      gated communities to the extent that they don't go out of
      their way to criticize them much. And many of those leaders
      have come to accept that this is a different idea needing a
      different name to avoid confusion. Moreover, these leaders
      have assumed a diminished role as open source has been
      adopted by more companies and people.</p>

      <p>A prime example of this was releasing the StarOffice
      source code under the GNU LGPL. Using that license, which is
      a favorite of many in "the open-source community," improved
      Sun's reputation.</p>

      <p>But even today there is a benefit to be had by gaining the
      acceptance of and positive statements from the pundits and
      leaders of "the open-source community" and of some of the
      smaller communities within it. For example, the Linux
      community is a thriving Unix community within the broader
      open-source community. By doing an open-source project, the
      organization running the project can get closer to that
      community.</p>

      <p>The open-source community was not a strong Java
      development community when NetBeans was open sourced in June
      2000. In fact, much of this community is not a strong C++
      development community, favoring C instead. Further, this
      community was slow to pick up Java partly because of Sun's
      ownership of it. By doing a full-up Java project as open
      source, Sun hoped to improve its standing with that
      community. Note that since then many successful Java
      open-source projects have been created and that there is now
      a very large and vibrant open-source community for Java.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="storytelling-through-connected-activities">
      <h2>Storytelling through Connected Activities</h2>

      <p>This is a general marketing-based goal. Typically
      marketing takes place via collateral material, events such as
      JavaOne and product launches and press releases. There are
      not very many ways to get small pieces of news into the
      world. Websites have helped with this. An open-source project
      has a website, mailing lists, and community events, but they
      are aimed more at developers and users than at the press and
      analysts. It is possible to tell these smaller stories within
      the context of normal open-source communications. For
      example, a developer could mention in a design consideration
      something that implies a new strategic direction for your
      company. Even simply having a developer at your company
      working hard at making some program or system work well on a
      competitor's system conveys a story about your company's
      values that is not possible to tell through normal marketing
      avenues.</p>

      <p>Storytelling was an explicit NetBeans goal, although it is
      not likely that many outside the inner circle of the
      NetBeans-community designers were comfortable thinking of it
      in this way. The Forte for Java product line is marketed
      partly through the open-source project, and statements about
      the Forte for Java direction are made indirectly through the
      actions and discussions by NetBeans developers working in the
      NetBeans community.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="statement-of-vision-and-terms-of-engagement">
      <h2>Statement of Vision and Terms of Engagement</h2>

      <p>Sometimes a company would like to make a statement of
      vision or establish new terms of engagement. This can be
      thought of as changing or adding to the conceptual landscape
      of the field or market. For example, when IBM wanted to
      establish itself further as a leader in part of the Java
      landscape, it released Eclipse as open source. Eclipse is "a
      kind of universal tool platform--an open extensible IDE for
      anything and nothing in particular."<sup><a href="#fn6"
      class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6" name="fnref6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p>At that time, the only significant open-source Java IDE
      was NetBeans. IBM had established itself as a supporter of
      open source through its support for Linux, and it had put out
      some small open-source projects such as Jikes, but it had yet
      to make a big statement of its beliefs in open source in the
      Java arena. Moreover, it didn't have an open-source Java IDE
      as its competitor, Sun, did. The full Eclipse story is
      recounted later.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="statement-of-values">
      <h2>Statement of Values</h2>

      <p>Doing an open-source project signals your company's belief
      in open-source principles and acknowledges that the world
      beyond your company is full of expertise and innovation. It
      is a statement of humility. Every open-source project
      achieves this result, at least to some degree.</p>

      <p>The previous example about working to enhance the
      performance of a competitor's product shows that your company
      cares about its customers and wants to provide them with the
      best products possible--even if they come from a
      competitor.</p>

      <p>The business goal that is achieved by affirming your
      company's values is indirect, helping to establish your
      company's reputation. This, in turn, influences how potential
      customers and business partners think about your company and
      what they expect in their dealings with your company.</p>

      <p>An important characteristic of a company is its
      trustworthiness. Trustworthiness is hard to come by--you
      cannot achieve it with a single act but only with a long
      sequence of good acts. Trustworthiness is also built by
      making what you do very transparent so that there are no
      secrets. Open source is a way to live in a glass house; and
      when people observe you acting well just as they often do,
      then your trustworthiness will increase.</p>

    <div id="get-brand-loyalty-for-your-companys-hardwaresoftware">
      <h2>Get Brand Loyalty for Your Company's

      <p>Creating a community of users and developers around an
      open-source project earns your company the reputation of
      being a "good guy," and that can create brand loyalty.</p>

      <p>Every company-sponsored open-source project has this goal,
      whether stated or not. For example, with NetBeans the primary
      business goal was to increase the number of Java developers
      by providing a solid Java IDE, but making it an open-source
      project helped Sun gain some brand loyalty for both the Sun
      and Java brands.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="get-the-hit-effect-working">
      <h2>Get the Hit Effect Working</h2>

      <p>By studying how movies and popular music become runaway
      hits, researchers have found that a large network of key
      influencers can cause a word-of-mouth wildfire to spread
      rapidly. If the right people speak favorably about a work,
      those favorable words can spread and the same favorable
      message bumping into the same person from different
      directions can cause that person to become a fan. This can
      happen with an open-source project when key influencers are
      in the community and are favorable to its projects.</p>

      <p>This is an important mechanism for ubiquity.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="create-a-marketplace">
      <h2>Create a Marketplace</h2>

      <p>By providing a ubiquitous open-source platform, you can
      create a marketplace for add-ons, support, and other related
      products and services. Having an open-source base platform
      greatly reduces the risk a player in the new marketplace must
      take on because there is no single owner of the underlying
      technology to possibly leave the market or go out of
      business.</p>

      <p>Building a marketplace can require a multistep process
      using at least two distinct approaches. The first is to build
      an open-source community around a single software project
      that can have associated, perhaps for-sale software developed
      by outside parties. NetBeans is an example. NetBeans is an
      IDE that enables modules conforming to certain APIs to be
      plugged into it, and these modules are the goods in the
      marketplace. Sun hopes that it can participate in the
      marketplace with proprietary software, and that the existence
      of the marketplace for Java increases the Java programmer
      population. Eclipse, originally an IBM open-source project
      and associated IDE, is another example of this approach. Part
      of this marketplace can be seen at the Eclipse plug-in
      website,<sup><a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"
      name="fnref7">7</a></sup> which describes itself as a portal
      and marketplace.</p>

      <p>The other approach is to build an infrastructure for a set
      of open-source projects centered on the technology around
      which the company wishes to form a market. Sun has built such
      an infrastructure and community called Java.net. Java.net is
      both a set of communities that creates Java software and a
      website containing infrastructure to host those communities.
      Groups and companies are encouraged to host their own
      open-source projects at Java.net at no cost, and, because
      there is also an active, portal-like community associated
      with Java.net, ideas and partnerships may spawn as well as
      source code spreading. Java.net is therefore like a great
      city attracting creative people into its neighborhoods. A
      second, loosely affiliated website called Java.com is
      provided where Java software can be advertised and sold. In
      each of these examples (NetBeans, Eclipse, and Java.net), an
      open-source approach was used to anchor a community that
      creates the desired marketplace.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="commoditize-competition">
      <h2>Commoditize Competition</h2>

      <p>Providing a no-cost offering can force a competitor to
      play a commodity game where small advantages and brand
      loyalty, for example, can play a stronger role than in a
      high-value game.</p>

      <p>OpenOffice is an example of this goal: Its free
      office-productivity software makes it more difficult for
      other companies, such as Microsoft, to charge large amounts
      for proprietary software with similar features. It transforms
      office-productivity software from a high-value, single-vendor
      product into a commodity.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="pricing-for-small-businesses">
      <h2>Pricing for Small Businesses</h2>

      <p>Small companies face problems that larger, more
      established companies do not. We have already mentioned how
      making a product open source reduces customer risk because
      the product can then survive a small company going out of
      business. Making a product open source can also resolve a
      potential problem of how to price the product.</p>

      <p>When a small company enters an existing market and
      underprices its product to be competitive, customers will
      wonder why the price is low. This suspicion may keep
      customers away from the new product. If the company meets
      market prices, then it comes up against many other issues
      that favor large, established companies. Making the product
      open source makes the question of pricing go away. Customers
      no longer wonder why the price is so low because this aspect
      of open source is understood. They are okay with the product
      being "free" and the small company charging for a nicely
      packaged version of the software, manuals, support, and
      training or consulting services.</p>

    <div id="acquisition-and-partnership--personal-and-corporate">
      <h2>Acquisition and partnership--personal and corporate</h2>

      <p>In the mid-1990s DOOM was released as open source. DOOM is
      a first-person shooter (FPS) game. Since then, there has been
      growth in the development and distribution of <em>mods</em> ,
      which are variants or updates to proprietary computer game
      engines that have game-extension capabilities such as
      scripting languages. The current range of mods includes new
      game types, game character models and skins (surface
      textures), levels (game play arenas or virtual worlds), and
      artificially intelligent game bots (in-game opponents). Two
      game companies, id Software and Epic Games, provide tools for
      creating mods and require essentially open-source licenses
      for their creation. Half-Life: Counter Strike is among the
      most popular of the FPS games (fall 2003) and was developed
      under an open-source license. The two primary developers now
      have a financial arrangement with Valve, the commercial
      developers of Half-Life, sharing in the revenue stream for
      Counter Strike.</p>

      <p>This is a business model in which developers create a
      market with an open-source project based around a commercial
      product. By increasing the size of the commercial product's
      market, these developers might be able to arrange a
      partnership with the commercial company or be bought out by
      it.</p>

      is no single or simple thread or fact that explains all
      aspects. That is, Eclipse was done as open source not for one
      strategic reason but instead for several.</p>

      <p>Since the time IBM committed to Java, the company had
      developed a strong competence and practice in Java. Because
      IBM values being able to work with customers on their own
      terms, it wanted to bolster Java in the marketplace so that
      it would not need to invest excessively in maintaining
      multiple expertises. Because Microsoft succeeds at least
      partly by providing good tools for developers, IBM wanted to
      establish serious competition for Microsoft Visual Studio in
      the eyes of developers. Further, IBM had had only modest
      success selling to customers who were not already IBM's. Open
      source provided legitimacy to appeal to the Linux, C, and
      Microsoft installed bases without involving much IBM baggage.
      Eclipse was a way to address these issues.</p>

      <p>There was also the issue of effort. For a plug-in
      technology such as Eclipse, the problems of integrating a
      variety of pluggable components were bigger than one company
      could continue to solve while providing sensible investments
      in the infrastructure, and open source could provide a way to
      share the costs while providing a broad set of tools.</p>

      <p>To accomplish these goals, IBM decided to engage the
      open-source community.</p>

      <p>Where did Eclipse come from? The Eclipse project was the
      natural follow-up to IBM's VisualAge family of development
      tools. Many of the substantial contributions to Eclipse came
      from a Canadian company IBM had acquired called Object
      Technology International (OTI), headquartered in Ottawa. OTI
      had previously developed IDEs and virtual machines
      (VMs)<sup><a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"
      name="fnref8">8</a></sup> for IBM's VisualAge Smalltalk and
      VisualAge Java. The early work on a Java-based IDE was part
      of a broader research effort on multiple language
      technologies at OTI where the IDE was given the internal name
      Eclipse.</p>

      <p>The goal of the OTI Eclipse project was to provide IBM
      product developers and key independent software vendors
      (ISVs) with a common, extensible tool platform competitive
      with Microsoft's Visual Studio. The first commercial release
      of Eclipse technology was IBM's VisualAge Micro Edition
      (later called WebSphere Studio Device Developer), an IDE for
      embedded Java development where important design constraints
      come from diminished computing and presentation
      resources.</p>

      <p>The Eclipse team had two primary objectives for the
      roll-out of the technology:</p>

      <p>Deliver technology to establish a perception of
      ubiquity--that developers, engineers, and users all use (this
      is a bottom-up developer-to-developer approach).</p>

      <p>Build an ecosystem or marketplace for companies to build
      commercial offerings on top of the open-source base; the hope
      was that this would generate a healthy tension between the
      paradigm of open source and the commercial need for
      profitable products.</p>

      <p>For many computer companies, a medium- and long-term
      strategy is to work with researchers and educators who then
      train their students on that company's products and
      technology. This translates into future sales and loyalty.
      This is one of the reasons that Unix and now Linux are as
      popular as they are--Unix was once a staple of university
      computer science and engineering departments. However, this
      requires investment and an understanding of the university
      and laboratory scene, which were problems for IBM. Eclipse
      provided technology that researchers could get excited
      about.</p>

      <p>Similarly, IBM had difficulties penetrating non-IBM
      installed markets despite the existence of both programs and
      investments in this area. In both these cases, IBM was unable
      to make headway in markets and communities important to its
      future. Eclipse provided the perception of independence and
      provided a forum for competitors and other IBM outsiders to
      observe and with which to engage.</p>

      <p>Eclipse could have been released as a free but proprietary
      tool, but IBM realized that the platform would see wider
      acceptance in the broader developer and vendor community if
      it were made a true open-source project. Furthermore, this
      would drive home the message that Java and open source could
      provide a serious challenge to Microsoft. By providing the
      ability to support platforms and languages other than Java,
      Eclipse enabled developers with existing languages and tools
      to benefit from the same IDE framework and tools, providing
      many of the benefits of Visual Studio Net. This reduced the
      need for expensive tooling for a wide variety of researchers
      and tool vendors.</p>

      <p>IBM therefore made a concerted effort to engage educators,
      researchers, vendors, and key influencers to move Eclipse
      from an IBM internal development to a full open-source
      project. The internal code name was familiar to developers,
      so IBM deviated from its normal naming practices and allowed
      the internal code name Eclipse.org to represent the project.
      This provided a lightning rod for developers expressing their
      frustration at Sun's control of Java.</p>

      <p>IBM brought some well-known names into the mix: Erich
      Gamma was the first author of <em>Design Patterns</em> , and
      Kent Beck was a founder of the software patterns community
      and the father of Extreme Programming. Gamma is now one of
      the main Eclipse project leaders, and he and Beck wrote a
      book called <em>Contributing to Eclipse: Principles,
      Patterns, and Plugins</em> , which is part of a new
      Addison-Wesley series called The Eclipse Series.</p>

      <p>IBM played its marketing hand quite well. IBM sponsored
      Eclipse receptions and workshops at major object-oriented
      programming conferences, produced the excellent book
      mentioned above, made research grants to universities, and
      eventually created an Eclipse conference, called EclipseCon.
      The Gamma-Beck book was given as a gift to all attendees of
      OOPSLA 2003 by IBM Research.</p>

      <p>This extraordinary marketing effort combined with the
      technical excellence of Eclipse resulted in the Eclipse
      project's having 50 corporate members and 18 million
      downloads by the end of 2003. Further, this success also
      motivated IBM to spin out Eclipse.org in 2004 as a nonprofit
      foundation; this new Eclipse.org has a tiered hierarchy of
      governance and management, with IBM retaining a small but
      significant degree of control in the form of having a member
      on the board of directors and a full-time executive director
      to lead the management team. Three separate councils oversee
      Eclipse development projects.</p>

      <p>As part of the spin-out effort, IBM reached out to other
      companies such as Sun, which was suspicious about IBM and had
      a major investment in its own IDE, NetBeans. Sun declined to
      join Eclipse.org.</p>

      <p>The result was that IBM gained the high ground and changed
      the landscape for competition in Java tools platforms.
      Eclipse is the exemplar in this area, and the vocabulary and
      terms of engagement in this arena are largely under IBM's
      control.</p>

      <p>Two facts about Eclipse raise the question of whether part
      of IBM's strategy was to deliver some tweaks to Sun as part
      of their cooperative/competitive relationship. First, even
      though the choice of the name Eclipse might not have been
      aimed originally at Sun, the fact that it has the meaning of
      overshadowing the Sun was probably not a negative factor in
      IBM's decision to use the code name as the external name.
      Second, IBM had always felt that Sun had been overbearing in
      its control and expansion of Java, and therefore IBM might
      have been trying to wrest some control from Sun and criticize
      it technically by using a different windowing toolkit from
      the standard one, which is called Swing. The toolkit Eclipse
      uses, called the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT), was
      considered by some to be easier to work with than Swing and
      performed better on the operating systems platforms to which
      it was targeted.</p>

      <p>The question of the toolkit, however, is complicated, as
      such things always are. A hallmark of the VisualAge family
      was portable support for native look and feel; this was
      carried forward with SWT, which leveraged OTI's peer-layer
      experience with Smalltalk IDEs. Because SWT already existed
      for WebSphere Studio Device Developer, time-to-market
      considerations added to the push to use SWT in Eclipse as a
      graphical user interface (GUI) for Eclipse-based tools.</p>

      <p>The Eclipse story is only one of IBM's engagements with
      open source, which includes working on Linux--again to create
      an alternative to the Microsoft platforms. Although IBM's
      commitment to Eclipse is significant, it spends much more on
      Linux.</p>

    "creating-your-business-model-and-following-through-with-it">
      <h2>Creating Your Business Model and Following Through with
      It</h2>

      <p>Every company is interested in activities that support its
      business. You must be able to explain how the relevant
      business goals for your project contribute to your company.
      Some of the goals we have listed, such as selling a
      proprietary product based on an open-source project, have a
      direct connection to revenue. Others have a more indirect
      connection, such as better relations with customers, making
      it easier to sell your company's hardware or services into an
      organization.</p>

      <p>For example, Sun makes most of its money by selling
      hardware, so any software that encourages customers to buy
      Sun servers or workstations supports Sun's main business
      model. It can do so directly by providing desired
      functionality and high quality, as Solaris does. It can do so
      by offering an alternative to software available on other
      platforms, such as StarOffice. It can try to level the
      playing field (or even tilt it in Sun's favor) by
      establishing new standards, as Java does. It can try to
      create a new market where Sun can be a major player, such as
      Jini. It can do so by gaining developer mindshare, so more
      applications for Sun hardware will become available, such as
      NetBeans. If shifting to open-source development will make
      these activities more likely to succeed, then a strong case
      can be made to do so. As an aside, please note that each of
      these strategies may be best supported by a different type of
      license; we discuss licenses in the next chapter.</p>

      <p>Many outside developers are suspicious of the motives of
      large companies and will view an open-source project
      sponsored by such a company as an attempt to pull a fast one.
      To quell these fears, you must be able to explain how your
      company plans to benefit from participating in the
      open-source project. Only when they understand what your
      company plans to gain will they be comfortable supporting the
      project. If they don't hear a sensible business reason for
      why your company is using open source, you can be sure that
      someone will suggest a variety of sneaky motives, often based
      on the fears open-source developers have that companies will
      steal their work and put it into proprietary products. If you
      are not willing to disclose your main business reasons, then
      you should rethink making your project open source.</p>

      <p>Your business model justifies your use of open source both
      to managers within your company and also to outside
      developers. It is important that you be able to communicate
      your business model to both groups.</p>

      <p>You will also need to explain your business model to other
      groups within your company that you need to interact with.
      Other parts of your company will expect your project to be
      business-as-usual and may not be happy when they find out
      otherwise. For example, if another group inside your company
      has a product that depends on yours, then you need to explain
      to them that the company does not control the release
      schedule and that your project will not do a release if your
      community feels the code isn't quite ready. You can expect
      there to be lots of pressure on your project to act like a
      normal proprietary project.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="measuring-success">
      <h2>Measuring Success</h2>

      <p>There are fairly standard ways of measuring whether a
      proprietary project is successful. These include product
      sales, market share, number of bugs, meeting schedule
      deadlines, and other familiar assessments. Many of these also
      apply to open-source projects, but there are additional
      metrics that are necessary.</p>

      <p>Each of the business goals for your project should have an
      associated measure. Here are some possible metrics for
      various business goals.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Ubiquity: number of users, number of mentions by the
        press, response by competitors</li>

        <li>Standards development: number of participating parties,
        number of parties adopting the standard</li>

        <li>Design help: number of additional user/designers,
        amount of email on mailing lists</li>

        <li>Development help: number of outside developers, number
        of bugs reported/fixed, number/quality of contributions,
        amount of email on mailing lists</li>

        <li>Appeal to community: quality and number of comments in
        open-source community</li>
      </ul>

      <p>By default your project will be measured the same way a
      proprietary one is, which will probably result in the
      open-source activities getting shortchanged. For a successful
      open-source project you need to get management to agree to a
      different set of metrics. The performance reviews for any
      employee participating in an open-source project need to
      include measures for their open-source-related activities.
      Note that just adding new metrics in with all the standard
      existing ones won't work; you cannot expect people to
      successfully do both their old jobs and take on the new tasks
      required to create a healthy open-source community.</p>
    </div>

    <div id=
    "an-example:-the-innovation-happens-elsewhere-strategy">
      <h2>An Example: The Innovation Happens Elsewhere
      Strategy</h2>

      <p>The business reasons for open source as presented tend to
      have a more tactical focus. Let's now look at an example of
      how open source might support a larger business strategy.</p>

      <p>Most companies are not large enough to influence the
      direction of their own markets, and few companies are able to
      design products that truly serve their customers. Most
      companies find they need to fine-tune designs and products
      over a series of releases. Some companies use time to
      introduce products: The Saturn car company started by
      introducing inexpensive but high-value cars that appealed to
      young adults just starting out in their careers, and, while
      learning the tastes and values of that generation, Saturn has
      introduced new models that reflect the increasing affluence
      of its core customer base. This is an example of using the
      world outside the corporation as a source of innovation.
      Software companies using open source can perhaps exploit this
      strategy in its most pure form. So, what is the strategy?</p>

      <p>To simplify the discussion, let's consider only companies
      that produce technology products. The Innovation Happens
      Elsewhere (IHE) strategy begins by recognizing where the
      company's proprietary value lies. Everything outside this
      inner circle of protected ideas and technology is available
      for instigating outside innovation beneficial to the company.
      The primary goal of the strategy is to increase the number of
      potential customers--that is, the size of the market
      available to the company. To do this, the IHE company tries
      to create more products in the market that either are
      enablers for the products the IHE company sells or form an
      aftermarket for them. Rather than trying to accomplish this
      alone, the IHE company tries to encourage other companies or
      organizations to do this work--but for their own
      purposes.</p>

      <p>The impetus for companies to do this comes from tools,
      technology, communities, and prototypes that the IHE company
      provides. By opening up part of itself to the outside, the
      IHE company can provide gifts that trigger the gift-economy
      effect: technology; tools, and prototypes that are of high
      value to outside companies and organizations and that trigger
      them to work in areas important to the IHE company; and
      communities where others can work within a culture that
      supports the vision of the IHE company (see Figure 4.1).
      Let's break this down a little.</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="fig4-1.gif" alt=
        "FIGURE 4.1. The Innovation Happens Elsewhere strategy">

        <p class="caption">FIGURE 4.1. The Innovation Happens
        Elsewhere strategy</p>
      </div>

      <p>Giving gifts of technology and tools initially spurs
      outside individuals to work on or with those gifts for their
      own benefit--perhaps one of the tools is useful to a software
      developer for one of his or her home projects. Later, that
      developer might bring the tool into his or her company, where
      colleagues start to use it for their own purposes. Because
      the tool was a gift (and perhaps its source is available),
      individuals and their companies send bug fixes, extensions,
      modules, and ideas back to the IHE company. The gift has been
      picked up--for selfish purposes--but it stimulates a gift in
      turn of work that is of value to the IHE company directly,
      which takes those tools, technologies, prototypes, and ideas
      back and uses them to enhance its own products. In the
      open-source realm, this is the fundamental expected payback
      for opening up software source. For the IHE company, this is
      only the beginning.</p>

      <p>Next, an outside company using gifts from the IHE company
      recognizes that these tools, technologies, and prototypes can
      be combined with its own technology to produce products at
      lower cost, at less risk, and of great value to their
      customer base. Again, this is done for selfish reasons, but
      such outside companies are, by doing this, contributing to
      expanding the customer base for the IHE company. Sometimes a
      company or organization will think of an application or
      variation of the gift that will open it up to entirely new
      and unexpected markets. This is the sort of return gift the
      IHE strategy can provide.</p>

      <p>Even further, the IHE company, by creating, building, and
      maintaining a set of communities around these gifts, can
      engage in serious conversations with outside companies,
      organizations, and individuals. Such conversations not only
      can improve the IHE company's products, designs, and
      directions, but also provides the IHE company with an
      opportunity to demonstrate leadership and vision, thereby
      putting it in a position to strongly influence the direction
      and structure of the competitive landscape. Because this is
      done in a context of gift-giving, culture exchange, and
      conversations, this is leadership and seduction, not control
      and power. If the IHE company exhibits learning in response
      to these communities, other members will continue to give
      gifts, work with the company, and help it maneuver through
      difficult competitive and market situations.</p>

      <p>Communities are also a way to tell stories to the
      community while minimizing the effects of cynical write-off.
      When a company puts out white papers, advertising, and other
      public relations materials, the audience is likely to
      discount as hype statements made there. But within a
      community, where developers and engineers are talking to each
      other, the messages can be both smaller--too small for press
      releases--and larger: global visions and proposals for new
      directions couched in design and other engineering
      statements. By valuing the comments and ideas from outside
      community members--by showing respect--the IHE company can
      create a channel unlike any other.</p>

      <p>The ability to communicate through communities such as
      this means that the IHE company can nudge the market in
      directions that play to its strengths. And by both
      demonstrating great innovation and respecting the innovation
      of others and by providing just the right gifts, the company
      can increase the size of its market and tune itself and its
      informal "partners" to that market, which is itself tuned
      through the vision of the company. That is, the market, the
      IHE company, and companies in the virtuous cycle of
      innovation co-evolve under the partial direction or influence
      of the IHE company.</p>

      <p>The IHE company takes direct advantage of the returned
      gifts from others, both by using them in its own products and
      by using them to help its internal operations. The IHE
      company puts itself in the best position when it embraces at
      all levels the philosophy of Innovation Happens Elsewhere
      with people in the company always looking inside and outside
      the company for innovation they and their groups can use.</p>

      <p>There are several keys to using this strategy. The first
      key is understanding and isolating the true proprietary value
      and technologies of the company. The more accurately this is
      done, the better able the company is to use its gifts and
      thrive. If what's proprietary and valuable to customers is
      too small, the company will have a hard time surviving as
      others crowd into its space. If what's judged proprietary and
      of value is too large--or too much of what the company makes
      or works on--then there will be few gifts available to get
      the cycle of innovation going.</p>

      <p>The second key is the confidence that your organization
      can engineer products well and quickly enough to stay ahead
      of competition. Microsoft, for example, does not believe it
      has enough of an engineering edge over competitors to do
      other than hold all its source code proprietary. Perhaps this
      is why it tries to combat open source rather than embracing
      it.</p>

      <p>The third key is a company culture that can embrace and
      celebrate innovations wherever they occur. In a sense, this
      is confidence and enthusiasm for ideas, but it is also
      respect and the right balance of pride and humility. Some
      organizations seem to fear ideas that originate from outside.
      Such organizations cannot use Innovation Happens
      Elsewhere.</p>

        <p class="caption">FIGURE 4.2. Sun's NetBeans IHE
        strategy</p>
      </div>

      <p>The effect is to increase the population of Java language
      programmers both by providing tools for those developers
      directly and through other companies building on the NetBeans
      platform. This way, not only is Sun Microsystems building the
      Java community, but so are other companies and individuals in
      the NetBeans community. Sun sells an IDE derived from
      NetBeans, but, most important, Sun sells server hardware that
      runs Java particularly well. Further, Java developers within
      Sun use NetBeans and Forte for their own work.</p>

      <p>An unexpected innovation happened when a group removed the
      Java-specific modules from the NetBeans IDE and replaced them
      with mapping, visualization, and analysis modules in order to
      build a modular environment for spatial analysis and
      visualization. This potentially opens up a future geographic
      information systems (GIS) market to Sun, a market not
      originally contemplated.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="lessons-from-the-ihe-strategy">
      <h2>Lessons from the IHE Strategy</h2>

      <p>There are many advantages to using open source, but being
      able to engage the Innovation Happens Elsewhere strategy is
      especially compelling. Not only does it build the market
      size, but the tactics to make it work help companies that use
      it get to better products faster by directly involving the
      customer base in their design. Through direct conversations
      with customers, there is reduced guesswork in gathering
      market requirements. Moreover, there are some operational
      efficiencies to be gained through better testing,
      community-based support, and some significant product
      contributions.</p>

      <p>Sometimes--no, usually--a surprise will happen; an
      innovation or application of the ideas and technology will
      come along that you have never dreamed of, never heard of, or
      couldn't imagine, done by a group or individual you have
      never heard of. And it could be a pivotal market for your
      company or could change how you view and develop your
      original technology.</p>

      <p>What is most stunning, however, is the difference in the
      feel of companies that truly engage with their communities of
      customers, partners, and competitors. Morale is boosted,
      progress is constant, and it simply feels like something good
      is always happening.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="business-reasons-for-using-open-source-products">
      <h2>Business Reasons for Using Open-Source Products</h2>

      <p>So far we've talked only about reasons to make one of your
      proprietary products into an open-source project. There is
      also the question of when it makes sense for a company to use
      an existing open-source product. We conclude this chapter by
      discussing some of the issues that arise from using
      open-source products in a company setting.</p>

      <p>Basically the same concerns arise with open-source
      software as with proprietary products:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Will it do what you need?</li>

        <li>What type of support is available?</li>

        <li>What is the total cost of ownership?</li>

        <li>Will the software product continue to be
        developed?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When purchasing a proprietary product you know how to
      answer these questions, but these answers don't apply for
      open source.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="meeting-your-needs">
      <h2>Meeting Your Needs</h2>

      <p>The first question is pretty much the same for any
      software under consideration--how do the features of the
      software match up with your needs? Open-source software is
      often less polished than commercial products, so you need to
      decide if extra polish is worth paying more for.</p>

      <p>Choosing software also involves looking at what other
      needs you have that might be met in future releases. Here the
      transparency of the open-source process makes it easier to
      get a handle on what new features are planned and when they
      might be ready--all of the planning happens on public mailing
      lists and is displayed in the project's roadmap--you can even
      send an email to the main developers. Most companies are much
      more guarded about planned release dates of proprietary
      products and what features will be in future releases.</p>

      <p>If a feature you need is missing, open source has an
      advantage in that you can work with the project to add it.
      You can lobby with the community about adding the feature,
      have your own developers write the needed code, or hire
      consultants to do so.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="getting-support">
      <h2>Getting Support</h2>

      <p>When you buy a product from a company, you expect that the
      company will stand behind its product by providing both a
      warranty and product support. If you have a problem, you
      believe that you can go to the company and legally it is
      required to fix that problem. Although this may be true for
      physical products such as automobiles, by far the majority of
      commercial software products come with very limited
      warranties and minimal support. If you've ever read the
      End-User License Agreement (EULA) for a piece of commercial
      software, then you know that the warranty is basically just a
      refund of your purchase price. And if you've ever tried to
      get basic, no-cost support from a large software company,
      then you know how difficult and frustrating it can
      be--although some do have lots of good information available
      through the company's website that more sophisticated users
      can take advantage of. Most companies do have support plans
      that you can purchase. Support may also be available from
      third-party companies.</p>

      <p>With open source, there is often no company to deal with.
      However, there is usually a community and that community
      exists in large part to support its members in the use of the
      software. This support takes two forms: online documents and
      discussion forums. When evaluating an open-source application
      you need to check both. Go to the project's website and see
      how much documentation is available, whether a good FAQ for
      it exists, and whether there are active mailing lists or
      newsgroups devoted to user questions. Check if the main
      developers participate in the user forums--tough questions
      that might stump a customer support person for a commercial
      product are often answered by the actual developers of an
      open-source project. Although getting support through a
      public mailing list may seem very informal, many who have
      tried it find it gets the job done, often more quickly and
      better than previous experiences with support for commercial
      products.</p>

      <p>For the more successful open-source applications, there
      are companies that sell support. For example, rather than
      downloading a free copy of the Linux operating system, many
      people choose to buy it from Red Hat because support is
      included. Other companies, such as Caldera, Linuxcare, and
      IBM, also offer support for Linux, as do many consultants.
      Some open-source projects have commercial versions that are
      supported--StarOffice is a supported commercial product sold
      by Sun that is based on OpenOffice.</p>

      <p>Training is related to support, and, indeed, for popular
      widespread open-source products it is easy to find training
      classes and books, both introductory texts and advanced
      reference material. Some publishers, such as O'Reilly,
      specialize in providing high-quality books on how to use
      open-source applications.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="total-cost">
      <h2>Total Cost</h2>

      <p>Open-source software is not always free--sometimes you may
      have to pay for it, as you do for the basic Red Hat Linux
      distribution--but what you are paying for usually is the
      convenience and quality assurance that went into packaging
      the software. Of course, once you have the software you can
      install it on as many computers as you wish (although the
      other installations might not be covered by the support
      agreement). So, instead of needing to purchase multiple
      licenses, one for each computer you wish to run the software
      on, open source immediately saves you money, possibly quite a
      lot of money. However, keep in mind that your total cost also
      includes the cost of deployment, training, and support, plus
      indirect operating costs due to ease of use (or, more
      appropriately, how difficult it is for your employees to do
      their jobs using it) and interoperability with other software
      you use. According to some studies, software and hardware
      costs account for less than 20% of the total cost.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="risk">
      <h2>Risk</h2>

      <p>Considering the expense involved in switching from one
      software application to another, you want to evaluate the
      future prospects of any software you choose: Will it continue
      to be a supported product, or will it be discontinued? If the
      company making it goes out of business, what happens?</p>

      <p>For open source it is important to assess the health of
      the project in order to be confident that the software will
      continue to be developed. To do so, look at the size of the
      community, check how much documentation is available, see
      whether a good FAQ for it exists, and browse through the
      various mailing lists and newsgroups associated with it to
      determine how active the community is. Also check to see how
      often there has been a new release of the software. Look at
      the project's road map to understand the overall vision.</p>

      <p>Even a small project with just a few developers may have
      advantages over a proprietary product. A single developer may
      be more willing to fix bugs and add features. Also, there is
      always the possibility of hiring the main developer as a
      consultant to make the changes you need. Finally, with an
      open-source project of any size your risk is always reduced
      because the source code is available to you.</p>

      <p>As with any company, an open-source project can disappear,
      and with it perhaps its source code and community. You may be
      able to retain rights to use, maintain, and further develop
      the source code if the license gives you those rights. By
      judging the health and importance of the project, you can
      decide whether this is a risk you wish to accept.</p>

      <p>There is another way that open source lets you choose the
      level of risk you are comfortable with. You can minimize your
      risk by using only the major releases that have undergone
      thorough testing. Or you can accept more risk if you want
      access to new features as soon as they have been added to a
      development build. Or you can choose to be somewhere in the
      middle by using the stable builds that are known to at least
      basically work and may have received some testing. Better
      yet, do your own testing if you have the resources.</p>

      <p>One last risk deserves mention if you wish to distribute
      an open-source application, possibly along with some of your
      own products, for use by your customers. By definition, open
      source can be redistributed, but you need to check the
      license that the software uses to determine if there are
      additional conditions that you must meet. If you have not
      made any changes to the software, but are merely
      redistributing binaries that you got directly from the
      project, then there should be no problems, although the
      license may require that you acknowledge the open-source
      project in your advertising materials or restrict your use of
      the project's name in product endorsements. If you have made
      changes to the software, then you may need to make the source
      code for those changes publicly available, depending on the
      license. Because open-source software does not include any
      warranty or support, your customers may expect you to provide
      both. Finally, some companies have tried to scare others away
      from using open source by falsely claiming that, if you
      merely bundle one of your proprietary programs on a CD with
      an open-source program, you then need to make your
      proprietary source code public--it's just not true: Your code
      stays yours.</p>

      <h2>Why Consider Open Source?</h2>

      <p>Open source is a commons-based means of doing continuous
      design, but the business reasons for joining or starting an
      open-source project go far beyond source code and distributed
      development. The reasons range over almost the entire
      spectrum of business-related activities: marketing, strategy,
      distribution, sales, human resources, and innovation. The
      last one--innovation--is the one that interests us most
      because without innovation there is no company, and not much
      fun either.</p>
