  <h1>2. Innovation Happens Elsewhere</h1>

  <p>At the beginning of the twenty-first century the biggest
  challenge high-tech companies face is how to innovate
  effectively. Effective innovation is finding the right
  innovations to invest in to make a good profit. To many, open
  source is about Linux and a few other software systems and how to
  use them to make an inexpensive backroom. But open source is also
  a practice and a tool for encouraging and harvesting innovations.
  Open source is a way for companies to engage in highly effective
  marketing--both in the sense of marketing a company, software,
  and brand, and in the sense of finding out what products and
  product features to build.</p>

  <p>Like any engine, an open-source innovation engine requires
  design, engineering, tuning, and maintenance. But to do those
  things requires understanding the science behind the machine.
  This is called &quot;innovation happens elsewhere.&quot;</p>

  <div id="open-source-is-a-commons">
    <h2>Open Source Is a Commons</h2>

    <p>Open source is fundamentally about people volunteering to
    work on projects in what could be called the <em>commons;</em>
    that is, it is about working on things for the public good. The
    sort of commons we are talking about is composed of things
    whose most basic value is not diminished by making a copy--in
    fact, making a copy in many cases increases its value. For
    example, if a piece of software is not for sale, then its value
    is not decreased if someone makes and uses a copy of it. If the
    software implements a collaborative tool, for example, then the
    additional copy makes it more valuable by increasing the number
    of people collaborating. Written works and knowledge are also
    part of this commons. Taking advantage of such a commons can be
    as simple as just taking what's there--this is permitted--but
    learning and applying the rules of engagement for the
    communities surrounding this commons can enhance the exchange
    and pave the way for putting works important to you in the
    commons and eliciting various forms of volunteer effort.</p>

    <p>Open source is not a small or niche movement. There are tens
    of thousands of open-source projects--the largest but not the
    only openly available open-source hosting site,
    Sourceforge,<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"
    name="fnref1">1</a></sup> in mid-2004 hosted over 80,000
    projects and had over 810,000 registered members. Interest in
    using open-source code residing in the commons by corporations
    is strong enough that some are starting to adapt their internal
    product life cycle and development methodologies to accommodate
    the nature of open source. And during this period of downturn
    for the technology portions of the economy, open-source
    projects are a means for software developers and designers not
    only to hone their skills on real-world projects but to expand
    their expertise in useful directions. Working on open-source
    projects, learning the tools and processes, and gaining
    expertise in various open-source applications and systems is
    likely to prove valuable, if for no other reason than that
    seeing other people's code and style expands your own horizons
    and makes you a better developer and designer.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="can-the-commons-make-a-difference">
    <h2>Can the Commons Make a Difference?</h2>

    <p>Although the commons we're talking about includes other
    things, it is largely the commons of source code licensed in
    such a way that many can work on it at the same time. The
    best-known software in this commons is Linux, which is a sort
    of Unix operating system. Linux can be viewed as a narrow
    technological phenomenon--of importance to some companies in
    the technology sector, but not affecting regular people in
    their homes and lives. To understand how the commons can
    benefit ordinary people, it's easier to look at other things in
    the commons, such as the World Wide Web. The Web is interesting
    because it is not only within the commons--built by a group
    effort--but forms part of the infrastructure of the commons.
    It's worth looking at the growth of the Web a bit to begin to
    understand the power of open source for business.</p>

    <p>For many, the Web is the first authority--not simply
    ordinary folks but professionals turn to the Web for
    information. Nearly all the scientific and technical journals
    the authors read are available online. Many people and most
    companies and other organizations put up websites and keep them
    up to date. Some are as ordinary and prosaic as a man talking
    about his hobbies and cats, and others are elaborate
    collections of essays and artwork or opinions and software.
    Today there are approximately 3 million distinct public
    websites,<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"
    name="fnref2">2</a></sup> and on average each site has about
    450 pages, meaning there are nearly 1.5 billion web pages. And
    this doesn't count web dark matter, which is information stored
    in databases that is served up using dynamic web page
    technology.</p>

    <p>The Web was built as a volunteer effort--there was no
    central planning, only a set of simple protocols and tools, and
    the idea took off on its own. The core of the Web is a protocol
    called http (HyperText Transfer Protocol), which enables one
    computer to request of another a particular resource--usually a
    web page--via the Internet. This protocol (http) works on top
    of the basic Internet protocols, and it can be considered a
    peer of other layered protocols such as email (smtp, Simple
    Mail Transfer Protocol) and file transfer (ftp, File Transfer
    Protocol). Three more things were needed from the
    infrastructure. The first was a way to describe web pages that
    was not based on a proprietary format. The choice here was the
    HyperText Markup Language (html). This was originally an
    extremely simple language--it was not capable of displaying
    precisely typeset material natively, but it was a language easy
    to learn. The second was a way to locate pages to display that
    didn't depend on what computer or operating system was being
    talked to--the Universal Resource Locator (URL). The third was
    the web browser.</p>

    <p>The keys to the remarkable success of this approach lay in
    the web browser more than in the other components. The first
    key was that the early web browsers tried their best to display
    something regardless of how imperfect the html describing the
    requested page was. The second was that web browsers could
    display the source html for the page being displayed. Using
    this feature, amateur web designers could find a page whose
    layout they liked and then mimic it for a page of their own.
    Even if they were not too careful in mimicking, the tolerant
    web browsers would probably show enough of what they intended
    to get by.</p>

    <p>With this tolerance for imperfectly described pages and such
    gifts as the early websites that the early creators provided,
    the Web took off in ways that couldn't have been foreseen.
    People used existing websites and their openly viewable source
    code to clone (with variations) web page design and put out
    their own content. People shared their hobbies and expertise.
    Organizations with special interests educated the public, and
    clubs spread interest in their club activities. Scientists and
    engineers started using the Web to disseminate their research
    results. Term papers, dissertations, and manias started
    appearing on the web, so that by 2003 there was almost
    literally no corner of human knowledge that was not at least
    mentioned on the Web. With the advent of search engines, it's
    now possible to find this information easily. It used to take a
    prodigious and obsessive person to be able to tell you the
    names of the poem and the poet given only a flawed memory of a
    line, but now anyone can answer such questions within 5 minutes
    given a browser and Internet connection.</p>

    <p>This growth came predominantly from the individual efforts
    of volunteerism. In many cases today, individuals pay to put up
    their websites--in other words, they pay to give something
    away. The Web has been used for independent news sources, and
    there are numerous examples in which web-based action has
    changed the course of history. There is little doubt that the
    Web has transformed how people work and interact. Weblogs
    (simple journal mechanisms) are flourishing and gathering
    enough power to affect politics, and wikis (reader-extendable
    websites) are being used to construct grassroots dictionaries
    and encyclopedias.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="the-commons-and-software">
    <h2>The Commons and Software</h2>

    <p>Open-source software--and the closely related variant, free
    software<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"
    name="fnref3">3</a></sup>--is being increasingly used in
    mainstream computing, meaning in information technology (IT)
    departments in companies and for consumer websites. Open source
    is becoming common through the Linux operating system and the
    Apache web server. In addition, there are open-source
    databases, compilers, window systems, programming languages,
    text editors, software development environments, productivity
    suites, and just about anything you can think of. The Apache
    web server is currently the one most commonly used for public
    websites. The use of the Linux operating system in commercial
    settings is spreading rapidly, poised to one day become
    predominant.</p>

    <p>Many companies beyond the early pioneers are embarking on
    more and more open-source or open-source-like projects,
    particularly those that are building platforms and require
    ubiquity. Moreover, many companies are adopting open source for
    some of their internal projects, especially those that are
    working on internal tools and utilities for which sharing
    across the company makes sense.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="open-versus-closed">
    <h2>Open versus Closed</h2>

    <p>According to Henry Chesbrough <em>(Open Innovation: The New
    Imperative for Creating and Profiting from Technology),</em>
    the traditional strategy for creating new technology and
    profiting from it is based on the old AT&amp;T/Bell Labs
    model:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Make sure the best and brightest people work for
      you.</li>

      <li>Invent new things and get them to market first, which
      means you'll win.</li>

      <li>Control intellectual property so no one else can get a
      toehold.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The model is a closed engine in which all innovation is
    company produced within closed walls. In the past, it not only
    was possible but common for large companies to corner the
    market on the smartest people in a technology field. But during
    the 1990s, this changed. As new companies started up, with the
    possibility of founders and early employees becoming instantly
    rich, researchers and advanced developers started moving around
    instead of staying with the same company for their entire
    careers. Knowledge was spread and an employee's loyalty to a
    particular company (and vice versa) became much rarer.</p>

    <p>The old model has broken down. As Chesbrough points out,
    although as recently as 1991 70.7% of industrial research and
    development (R&amp;D) spending was done by companies with
    25,000 employees or more, by 1999 this figure had dropped to
    41.3%. Moreover, as we see later, the first-mover advantage,
    wherein the company with the first product in a new space gains
    and retains a market-share advantage, is a myth. The newer
    model is to look for innovations wherever they may pop up and
    use them carefully by layering on unique value. Proprietary
    research to innovate still makes sense, but not to the
    exclusion of looking outside a company's own firewalls.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="use-of-the-commons:-creativity-and-conversations">
    <h2>Use of the Commons: Creativity and Conversations</h2>

    <p>At the heart of the reasons for a company to use open source
    is the nature of creativity. Creativity arises from diversity
    of ideas and viewpoints. Such ideas and viewpoints are spawned
    from conversations, either through direct dialog with people or
    through indirect interaction through artifacts such as art,
    literature, song, and technology.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="creativity">
    <h2>Creativity</h2>

    <p>Creativity is regarded by many as a talent that some people
    are blessed with and others not. Talent, however, is simply
    what comes easily. For artists, scientists, engineers, and
    writers, creativity comes from the ability to put together
    various triggers that they happen on; a <em>trigger</em> is
    anything that causes a thought to come to mind. Imagine a group
    of people in the distant past trying to figure out how to
    achieve better workplace collaboration. When the members of
    this group observed sports teams operating smoothly, they found
    many triggers there: specifically defined roles, coaching, and
    game plans. In fact, sports acted as a set of triggers for
    understanding and operating on workplace collaboration. So
    powerful were these triggers that we've adopted some of their
    names into our vocabulary of business teamwork.</p>

    <p>The term <em>trigger</em> is borrowed from <em>The
    Triggering Town</em> by the twentieth-century poet and writing
    teacher Richard Hugo, who used it to teach writing poetry:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>A poem can be said to have two subjects, the initiating or
      triggering subject, which starts the poem or
      &quot;causes&quot; the poem to be written, and the real or
      generated subject, which the poem comes to say or mean, and
      which is generated or discovered in the poem during the
      writing. That's not quite right because it suggests that the
      poet recognizes the real subject. The poet may not be aware
      of what the real subject is but only [has] some instinctive
      feeling that the poem is done. (p. 4)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>For Hugo, a trigger is what starts a poet off in a
    particular direction. That direction can change or the ultimate
    thrust of the poem can be something else or simply perceived as
    something else, but the trigger is the creative spark that gets
    things going. Triggers are in fact ubiquitous in human life. We
    find them operating in art, engineering, and the sciences.</p>

    <p>Looking at literature more broadly we see connections
    between works--much of our literature is a response to other
    writings and writers. In art we notice that when one painter
    started the style later called Impressionism, many others
    followed the trigger. Where did Impressionism come from? In his
    essay on the origins of Impressionism, Louis Emile Edmond
    Duranty quotes a letter from the artist Eug&egrave;ne
    Fromentin:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>A sculptor or a painter has a wife or a mistress who is
      slim, light, and lively, with a turned-up nose and small
      eyes. He loves these things in her, even with their faults.
      Perhaps he even went through a passionate affair to win her.
      Now, this woman--who is the ideal of this artist's heart and
      mind, who has aroused and revealed his true taste,
      sensitivity, and imagination because he has discovered and
      chosen her--is the absolute opposite of the feminine ideal
      that he insists on putting into his paintings and statues.
      Instead he keeps returning to Greece, to women who are
      somber, severe, and strong as horses. In the morning he
      betrays the turned-up nose that delights him at night, and
      straightens it. Consequently he either dies of boredom or
      brings to his work all the gaiety and effort of thought of a
      box-maker who is skilled at gluing and who wonders where he
      will go to have some fun after he has finished
      work.<sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"
      name="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Or, Duranty goes on to say, the living woman will displace
    the Greek Venus and we will see instead the slim, light, and
    lively woman with the turned-up nose. She has become a trigger.
    And such triggers coming from life--the way light works to form
    color, the movement and natural poses of ordinary people, and
    the idea that an actual viewer cannot see everything--gave rise
    to Impressionism, whose practitioners and works became triggers
    to other painters and which combined with other triggers to
    instigate the styles and movements in art we see today.</p>

    <p>Brainstorming groups work precisely because the number of
    diverse triggers available is large and the group is encouraged
    to make associations that normally would be edited out quickly.
    For such groups to work well, there have to be three main
    ingredients: a willingness to contribute ideas with relative
    abandon, a willingness to surrender ownership and protection of
    your ideas to the group, and a willingness to accept the
    responsibility of nurturing and continuously improving any
    ideas generated by the group as if they were your own. These
    principles guide not only successful brainstorming groups, but
    also such diverse activities as writers' workshops,
    appreciative inquiry, and design charrettes.</p>

    <p>Some triggers are legendary. Isaac Newton thought of the
    laws of gravity after being struck by the idea that an apple
    would fall from a tree regardless of how high it was while the
    moon, surely affected by the same force as the apples, remained
    at a distance. The apple was a trigger to a series of thoughts
    that led to good science.</p>

    <p>In problem solving, triggers include descriptions of
    characterizations or descriptions of existing knowledge and
    techniques that cause the problem solver to home in on an
    approach to try. These descriptions are usually general or
    abstract, so there is an ability required to see the
    connection. But additional triggers can appear from anywhere
    and can have remarkable effects. Many scientists and
    mathematicians report that the solutions to problems appeared
    to them while they were engaged in some other activity. Things
    happening in their lives acted as triggers.</p>

    <p>Companies in a particular market use one another as
    triggers, looking at how the others approach the market and
    making both small and large improvements, making products where
    the market has left holes in the product space, and combining
    product ideas from other companies. For example, it is
    well-known that Microsoft used the Apple Macintosh as a trigger
    for their Windows products. Apple used the Xerox PARC Star as a
    trigger for the Macintosh window system. And Xerox PARC used
    earlier window-like systems as their triggers, such systems as
    the Stanford AI Lab's DataDisk system, Doug Engelbart's On-Line
    System (NLS) from his Augmentation of Human Intellect project
    at Stanford Research Institute (now known as SRI International)
    in the 1960s, the later windowing work at MIT on Lisp machines,
    and Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad system from 1962. And, of
    course, all such systems were triggered by paper, artists'
    canvases, and blackboards.</p>

    <p>It's easy to think that triggers can't be of much use in the
    real business world because there is so much evidence that the
    company that comes up with an idea first is the one that
    benefits the most. Coupled with strong intellectual property
    laws, it must be getting even worse now.</p>

    <p>The power of triggers and the relative immunity of a
    company's success to not being first can be found in the work
    of Gerard J. Tellis and Peter N. Golder. In their book <em>Will
    &amp; Vision: How Latecomers Grow to Dominate Markets,</em>
    Tellis and Golder carefully define <em>pioneers</em> and
    <em>markets</em> and come to what some business theorists
    consider counterintuitive findings about the first-mover
    advantage. Traditional wisdom holds that first movers dominate;
    one market study showed that in the steady state, market
    pioneers hold a 30% share of their markets, whereas latecomers
    hold 13%. Another study found that about 70% of current market
    leaders pioneered the markets they dominate. Tellis and Golder
    note that these studies actually measure the effect of early
    leaders, not the true pioneers, with part of the blame for the
    flawed studies lying at the feet of the current market leaders
    who, when interviewed, tend to not know the technological
    history of their market well.</p>

    <p>For example, Procter &amp; Gamble claims it created the
    disposable-diaper market in 1961, the implication being that
    they invented the disposable diaper and thereby created the
    market. In fact, they were simply an early leader; Johnson
    &amp; Johnson developed disposable diapers (called Chux) in the
    1930s for hospital use and manufactured them for other uses by
    1936 or 1937. Two other quick examples: Gillette entered the
    safety razor market in 1903, but a company called Star had
    introduced a safety razor in 1876. HP entered the laser printer
    market in 1984, but IBM had one on the market in 1975 (the
    3800).</p>

    <p>Tellis and Golder define a <em>pioneer</em> as &quot;the
    first firm to commercialize [a] product&quot; (p. 32) and a
    <em>market</em> as &quot;a competitive environment in which
    firms attempt to satisfy some distinct but enduring consumer
    need&quot; (p. 33). Using these definitions, they found in
    examining 66 markets that the failure rate for pioneers was
    almost 65%. In only 9% of the markets were the current market
    leaders true pioneers--and the average market share of the
    survivors is now a mere 6%. The real success goes to early
    leaders--firms that entered the market an average of 19 years
    after the pioneers and currently have a market share three
    times the size of the pioneers.</p>

    <p>This means that being the first to market is not necessary
    for success. In the cases Tellis and Golder discuss, a
    pioneer's inventive efforts form a trigger that the eventual
    leader picks up on. Improvements are made, often continual
    improvements as the product matures. But the time span between
    the introduction of the pioneer's product and the eventual
    leader's product contains the customer (or user) response to
    the idea (and technology) and forms its own small commons that
    the eventual leader uses to gather information and innovation
    to make the product a success.</p>

    <p>Tellis and Golder's point is that a visionary company with
    enough persistence can come to dominate a market. The vision is
    usually of the widespread use of a technology product--which
    implies an acceptably low price--and the persistence is to
    stick with product development long enough to achieve an
    acceptable price for an acceptable product.</p>

    <p>This brings up another theme important to open source that
    we explore later--<em>continuous (re)design.</em> Continuous
    (re)design is the way that artifacts in the commons are
    improved--not only their implementations but their designs--by
    the acts of people improving small pieces, adapting the
    technology to other applications, and finding new ideas that
    might apply.</p>

    <p>A nearly perfect example is Sony and the videorecorder.
    Ampex produced the first videorecorder in 1956, which initially
    sold for $75,000. It recorded only in black and white on 2-inch
    tape. It was such a hit that by 1960 a mass-produced version
    was selling for $50,000 to about 100 customers a year. Also in
    the 1950s, Sony's cofounder, Masaru Ibuka, had a similar
    vision, but with an important difference. Ibuka's vision was
    for a low-cost home version of the videorecorder. In pursuit of
    this vision, he asked his engineers to come up with a
    videorecorder, which they did for a selling price of $55,000.
    Ibuka, believing in a home rather than a professional market
    for videorecorders, asked them to redesign it to cut the price
    by 90%, which they did. But then he asked them to redesign it
    to cut the price by another 90%. It took 20 years for the whole
    engineering process, but eventually (in 1975) Sony released the
    Betamax, which sold for under $1000 and over the next 15 years
    Sony's annual sales grew from $17 million to $2 billion while
    Ampex's never even reached $500 million. And while this was
    happening, JVC and Matsushita grew to $5 billion between them.
    The latecomers were selling $7 billion in recorders, but the
    pioneer, Ampex, was stuck at 6% of the market.</p>

    <p>What this means for open source is that doing secret
    development in hopes of springing a new product on the
    marketplace to gain the much-coveted first-mover advantage
    rarely works. In almost every market, the technology is well
    known and many pioneers have failed or are failing. It is a
    race to see which firm can come up with the enduring product
    for a large market, and an enduring market comes from matching
    users' needs well with an affordably priced product. Matching
    users' needs requires interacting with them; affordable pricing
    requires, for software, primarily low maintenance costs.</p>

    <p>If there is no first-mover advantage, then it doesn't matter
    too much whether the early work is done inside a company's
    firewalls or in the commons. And it doesn't matter that the
    early work can serve as a trigger to many companies because
    that happens already. But we return to this theme shortly.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="conversations">
    <h2>Conversations</h2>

    <p>The second half of how the commons works for a company is
    the conversations. These take many forms. The best way to think
    about this is by analogy to a great city, by which we mean a
    city where people gather to exchange goods, culture, food, and
    ideas. Although all cities do these things to a certain degree,
    the great cities stand out.</p>

    <p>Every place great with creativity is a confluence of smaller
    communities of interest and practice whose proximity serves as
    triggers for further creation. Renaissance Florence was great
    not because there were only painters there, but because there
    were also sculptors, goldsmiths, poets, writers, clerics,
    architects, builders, and an expectation of great creation.
    Today in places such as San Francisco, London, Boston, Austin,
    San Diego, and Prague there is tremendous diversity of
    thoughts, artists, technologists, chefs, theaters, and
    workshops. This is why companies and individuals flock to those
    places; that's why it's invigorating to be in them.</p>

    <p>In <em>The Rise of the Creative Class,</em> a recent study
    on the transformation of work, Richard Florida writes about
    creativity and places like this:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Creative people... cluster in places that are centers of
      creativity and also where they like to live. From classical
      Athens and Rome, to the Florence of the Medici and
      Elizabethan London, to Greenwich Village and the San
      Francisco Bay Area, creativity has always gravitated to
      specific locations. As the great urbanist Jane Jacobs pointed
      out a long time ago, successful places are multidimensional
      and diverse--they don't just cater to a single industry or a
      single demographic group; they are full of stimulation and
      creative interplay. (p. 7)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In a context like this, communities do what they do
    best--create a wide-ranging portfolio of resources. In doing
    this, they are mimicking the great cities in history, which
    were not simply confluences of diverse and creative people but
    also a source of rich culture, galleries, books, workshops,
    teachers, students, caf&eacute;s, cuisines, architectural
    styles, and building methods. A great city is creative only if
    things are created there.</p>

    <p>A great city concentrates triggers, creating the context for
    creativity, and it also brings the possibility of important
    conversations: between poets and sculptors, between
    businesspeople and painters, and between clerics and composers.
    If our software commons is also a community, we can expect
    other sorts of important conversations: between customers and
    companies, between designers and users, between designers in
    one company and designers in another, between developers and
    users, between marketing and customers, and between developers
    in one company and developers in another. Under the right
    conditions, these conversations can do important things for a
    company. First, the company can rapidly learn how to improve
    its products. The conversations are direct, which means that
    the cost of having them can be low and the translation to
    concrete product-based actions can be efficient. Second, by
    inviting customers and others into the circle of trust, the
    realities of doing business--such as delays caused by product
    cycles and rushed quality assurance--will be less likely to be
    held against the company. The nature of the relationship is
    entirely different. It is more akin to the gift economy that we
    experience in our families and religions than to the commodity
    economy that dominates business. In such gift-based
    relationships, the goals are collaboration, joint authorship,
    and appreciative inquiry. We say more about this later; for
    now, keep in mind that the sorts of open-source projects talked
    about in this book combine the commodity and gift cultures.</p>

    <p>As mentioned earlier, Tellis and Golder attribute enduring
    market leadership to two qualities: will and vision. They think
    of these largely as attributes of the leaders of the enduring
    market-leader companies, but perhaps they need only be traits
    of the companies. An enduring market leader is a company that
    dominates and has dominated its market for many years, often
    dozens. For this definition to make sense, only mass markets
    make sense, and this is reflected in their definition of a
    <em>market</em> as a competitive arena that satisfies an
    enduring consumer need. <em>Consumer,</em> of course, is not a
    pretty word and is considered by many to be
    insulting<sup><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"
    name="fnref5">5</a></sup> --a company has one major interaction
    with consumers: It sells to them.</p>

    <p>Vision, to Tellis and Golder, has to do with how a person or
    company envisions the consumers or mass market for a product.
    For example, the true vision of Sony's cofounder was not the
    videorecorder but a videorecorder for the masses priced at
    $500. What he envisioned was not making copies of broadcast
    material, but millions of faces sitting in front of TVs playing
    back recorded material broadcast earlier. The trigger of all
    research aimed at implementing such visions is not the thing
    itself or its technology but its price. Because achieving a
    vision requires an almost absurd amount of research and
    development, companies and their visionaries require an almost
    absurd amount of willpower and persistence to keep at it until
    the technical and manufacturing breakthroughs can be made that
    enable the mass market (pricing) vision to be realized.</p>

    <p>If we were to stop here, the lesson would not be important;
    the lesson would be that it pays to be lucky enough to have the
    resources to keep working until you get it right. But keep in
    mind that you need to do the refinements, but it's a lot easier
    if you have resources from some other source.</p>

    <p>An important characteristic of enduring market leaders is
    that they usually initially deliver a fairly low-quality
    product that is just good enough for the consumer, followed by
    a lengthy conversation with the consumer to determine what
    sorts of features and level of quality are actually required.
    After this, the enduring market leader's products often
    eventually outstrip the niche high-quality-product companies'
    products. In other words, the will or persistence that Tellis
    and Golder speak of is not akin to stubbornness; it is a form
    of continuous (re)design.</p>

    <p>The pattern is to start modestly and improve according to
    the dictates of the users, to get something of acceptable
    quality into the largest marketplace you can and then later
    improve or add a narrower focus with higher-quality, more
    inventive products. This pattern has come to be known as
    &quot;worse is better,&quot;<sup><a href="#fn6" class=
    "footnoteRef" id="fnref6" name="fnref6">6</a></sup> and its key
    is the conversation that takes place between the users of a
    product or technology and its designers and builders.
    Unfortunately, the primary exemplars of this pattern are within
    the technology-for-technologists sector.<sup><a href="#fn7"
    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7" name="fnref7">7</a></sup></p>

    <p>That is, the users are developers and artifacts that fall
    into this category include operating systems (Unix),
    programming languages (C), and text editors (Emacs). The idea
    is that the users of a technology are provided with an early
    version of it, which they can extend and improve over time. The
    early version should be complete enough to be useful, but
    should not be particularly fully featured, and ideally the
    usage patterns should not be nailed down completely so that a
    wide range of possible design and implementation features is
    feasible. Then by conversing with the users--through email,
    code exchanges, and design discussions--the technology can be
    moved forward according to the most dominant and interesting
    uses.</p>

    <p>This approach is called &quot;worse is better&quot; for two
    reasons: to indicate that the initial release is not what would
    normally be considered product quality or complete and to
    emphasize that it is acceptable to stop short of a perfect
    design. When you can afford the discipline of allowing the
    users of a technology to help design it and be part of its
    future, the result is usually designed as well or better than
    the original designers could have done and is almost always
    better suited or adapted to its users.</p>

    <p>&quot;Worse is better&quot; works by taking advantage of
    conversations with users, but the key is to listen and design
    with discrimination--not every suggestion should be followed.
    In most cases, there will be a handful of surprising ideas that
    should be grabbed for follow-up. Coming up with new ideas is
    not as difficult as selecting which ones to implement--the more
    ideas on the table, the more likely a good one is there ready
    to be found. The choice is sometimes more reliably made when
    there are several minds looking at the question, and that's
    what &quot;worse is better&quot; promotes.</p>

    <p>When we put this approach together with the observation by
    Tellis and Golder that being first with a previously unknown
    product is not very important, we can see that there is little
    risk in using the commons for collaborative design and
    implementation.</p>

  <div id="diversity-and-selection-versus-continuous-redesign">
    <h2>Diversity and Selection Versus Continuous (Re)design</h2>

    <p>There are actually two ways to achieve excellence in design
    and execution: (1) diversity followed by selection and (2)
    continuous (re)design. In the diversity and selection approach
    lots of artifacts are produced and the best are picked. For
    example, when we visit the Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay in Paris to
    view the Impressionist paintings, we notice that they're all
    quite good. Partly this is because the painters were good and
    they were exploring the beginnings of a new way of painting,
    but partly this is because we are seeing only the best
    Impressionist work. When we read the great poems of William
    Butler Yeats, we are reading only a selection of his work. When
    we harvest triggers, we are selecting from a diversity.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, continuous (re)design takes a good
    starting place and revises and revises until that starting
    artifact has become as good as it can be. When a great poet
    revises heavily, we often see very good work--certainly it
    demonstrates deep knowledge and practiced craft.</p>

    <p>In fact, the best work is always the result of a combination
    of the two approaches. And both approaches and their implied
    practices apply to open source and how it moves forward.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="innovation-happens-elsewhere-1">
    <h2>Innovation Happens Elsewhere</h2>

    <p>Innovation happens everywhere, but there is simply more
    elsewhere than here. Silly as it sounds, this is the brutal
    truth: Regardless of how smart, creative, and innovative you
    believe your organization is, there are more smart, creative,
    and innovative people outside your organization than inside. In
    addition, the majority of elsewhere doesn't particularly care
    to make products in your space. But customers already using a
    product for real work are in a good position to offer
    suggestions about the directions in which that product should
    evolve. Even if such users don't have concrete suggestions, the
    ways that they use the product can provide hints about how to
    improve it. Remember, innovation comes from triggers, and the
    trigger does not have to be aware of what it is triggering.
    Just as a palm tree near the beach at sunset can trigger a
    poet's masterpiece without any thought whatsoever, a user using
    a product or mentioning a circumstance of its use can trigger a
    major product direction in a designer prepared to receive such
    a trigger.</p>

    <p>As Henry Chesbrough points out, R&amp;D spending profiles
    suggest that it is less and less common for innovative people
    to be found at large companies with virtual monopolies in
    specific technology areas. Not all the smart people work for
    you, you cannot afford to try to create all the innovations
    yourself, and you cannot provide enough triggers internally to
    find the stunning new product idea.</p>

    <p>More and more the game is about being connected rather than
    about domination. The worst thing that you could do would be to
    allow &quot;innovation happens elsewhere&quot; to become
    &quot;revenue happens elsewhere.&quot;</p>

    <p>To succeed, companies need to find ways to use outside
    innovations and to become part of a distributed fabric of
    innovation through a combination of licensing and well-chosen
    gifts. Although the concept of a gift may not at first seem to
    fit well with free-market capitalism, it might when thought of
    in the context of collaborating with others to build common
    commodity-like infrastructure. If it makes business sense in
    that context, then perhaps it makes business sense in
    others.</p>

    <p>This is what open source is all about: harnessing engines of
    innovation in software.</p>
