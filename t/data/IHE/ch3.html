<div id="what-is-open-source">
  <h1>3. What Is Open Source?</h1>

  <p>There is an existing large open-source community with
  established practices and culture. Companies and others wishing
  to start or join an existing open-source project need to
  understand the ground rules and established practices for this
  larger community because the term <em>open source</em> sets
  expectations that need to be either met or explained. A good way
  to conceptualize this is to think of the open-source community as
  a foreign country with its own culture and every open-source
  project as existing in that country. Although it might be
  possible to impose different cultural rules on that project, it
  is more likely to be easier to adopt existing customs. Therefore,
  understanding open source as it exists is crucial to success.</p>

  <p>There are many definitions of what constitutes open source.
  The basic idea is very simple: By making the source code for a
  piece of software available to all, any programmer can modify it
  to better suit his or her needs and redistribute the improved
  version to other users. By working together, a community of both
  users and developers can improve the functionality and quality of
  the software.</p>

  <p>Thus to be open source requires that anyone can get and modify
  the source code and that they can freely redistribute any derived
  works they create from it. The different licenses have various
  wrinkles on whether modifications must also be made into open
  source or if they can be kept proprietary.</p>

  <p>Later in this book we also discuss cases that do not meet the
  full definition of open source but do involve some form of
  collaborative development of the source code, for example,
  Java.</p>

  <div id="open-source-in-brief">
    <h2>Open Source in Brief</h2>

    <p>In practice, a typical open-source project uses a web or
    other Internet site as the repository for the source code,
    documentation, discussions, design documents, bug and issue
    lists, and other artifacts associated with the project. A
    particular person or group is the copyright owner for the
    source, at least initially, and this owner grants permission
    for individuals or other groups to make modifications to the
    source mediated through a version control system such as CVS
    (Concurrent Versions System). Periodic builds are automatically
    produced, and there are usually several versions of varying
    stability and age compiled and prebuilt for a number of
    platforms that anyone can download and try out.</p>

    <p>Although the owners of the source essentially have total
    control of the project, they generally will enlist the advice
    of the community about its direction. Sometimes contributors
    retain copyright of their own contributions while licensing
    them under the same or compatible license, and other times the
    contributors assign copyright to the owners of the project.</p>

    <p>Ownership versus licensing is an important distinction to
    grasp. Even when rights are broadly granted through a license
    with considerable freedom about what an outside party can do
    with the source, the source code is still owned by the
    copyright holders who can do whatever they wish with it,
    including selling it, granting other licenses to it, or
    changing the direction of its development.</p>

    <p>Often a project will be broken into modules, which can be
    thought of as logical or conceptual wholes, and a <em>module
    owner</em> is assigned to each. The module owner is in charge
    of inspecting proposed source changes and deciding whether to
    accept them or not. The module owner can also grant check-in
    privileges to developers who have earned his or her trust so
    that they can also modify the official source code. In many
    open-source projects, the overall owner and the module owners
    are the primary contributors while others contribute a small
    percentage of the work. In general, debugging through use is
    the significant source of contributions from the larger
    community.</p>

    <p>Some open-source projects, especially those whose source is
    owned by companies, establish a governance mechanism that
    ensures that the community has a recognized voice in decision
    making, which in turn makes the playing field more level than
    it otherwise might be.</p>

  <div id="a-quick-history-of-open-source">
    <h2>A Quick History of Open Source</h2>

    <p>In 1984, Richard Stallman formed the Free Software
    Foundation<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"
    name="fnref1">1</a></sup> and started the GNU project (GNU is
    an acronym for &quot;GNU's Not Unix&quot;). He did so in
    response to seeing the collapse of the software-sharing
    community at the MIT AI Lab as everyone left to join companies
    making proprietary software. Stallman coined the term <em>free
    software</em> to express his philosophy that programmers should
    be allowed access to the source code so they could modify it to
    suit their needs. He developed the GNU General Public License
    (GPL) to assure that he would always be able to see and modify
    the source code for any software he wrote, along with the
    modifications made by anyone else who might work on it. A
    number of important Unix tools and utilities have been
    developed as part of the GNU project, including the GNU GCC
    compiler and GNU Emacs.</p>

    <p>In 1989 the University of California at Berkeley released
    its networking code and supporting utilities as Networking
    Release 1, the first freely redistributable Berkeley Software
    Distribution (BSD). This was followed in 1991 with Networking
    Release 2, which contained almost all the source code for BSD
    Unix (all but six files were included).</p>

    <p>In 1991 Linus Torvalds started work on the Linux kernel
    under the GNU GPL and around 1992 combined it with the
    not-quite-complete GNU system to produce a complete free
    operating system. In 1995 Red Hat Software was formed to sell
    CD-ROMs and to offer support and services for the users of Red
    Hat Linux.</p>

    <p>In 1995 a group of webmasters created the Apache project,
    based on the NCSA web server. Apache 1.0 was released later
    that year. According to the February 2004 Netcraft web-server
    survey, the Apache web server is more widely used than all
    other web servers combined and currently has over 67% of the
    web-server market.</p>

    <p>In 1998 Netscape announced they would release the source
    code to their Navigator browser and 3 months later did so.
    Partly in response to the Netscape announcement, a group of
    leaders in the free software community, including Sam Ockman,
    John &quot;maddog&quot; Hall, Eric Raymond, and Larry Augustin,
    met to discuss how to better market the ideas of free software.
    They decided to use the term <em>open source</em> and, working
    with others, created the Open Source Definition,<sup><a href=
    "#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2" name=
    "fnref2">2</a></sup> which is based on the <em>Debian Free
    Software Guidelines</em> written by Bruce Perens for the Debian
    Linux distribution. They created an organization, the Open
    Source Initiative, to further the ideas of open source and to
    certify licenses as being true open source. There is a
    continuing tension between those who support <em>free
    software</em> and those who favor <em>open source</em> due to
    different philosophical outlooks.</p>

    <p>More details on the history of open source are available
    online and in such books as <em>Open Sources: Voices from the
    Open Source Revolution</em> edited by Chris DiBona, Sam Ockman,
    and Mark Stone or <em>Rebel Code: Inside Linux and the Open
    Source Revolution</em> by Glyn Moody.</p>

  <div id="hybrid-open-source">
    <h2>Hybrid Open Source</h2>

    <p>In pure open-source projects, all the workers are
    volunteers. There are rarely if ever formal processes that are
    followed or formal specifications produced. The team may or may
    not have usability experts, documentation writers, testers, or
    project management of any variety. In some circles, this form
    of open source is called &quot;all-volunteer open source.&quot;
    Basically, whoever shows up is the team.</p>

    <p>When companies start open-source projects, it is typical for
    those projects to be part of (or all of) a company initiative
    being done for strategic purposes and aims. Because many
    companies use a more traditional or conventional development
    process, such companies starting open-source projects are
    likely to want to engage the open-source community with some of
    their traditional tools and in-house experts. When this
    happens, we call it a &quot;hybrid open-source
    project.&quot;</p>

    <p>For example, GE started its Visualization Toolkit
    open-source project,<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id=
    "fnref3" name="fnref3">3</a></sup> but they wanted to establish
    a strong cultural value around testing and quality. Based on
    some ideas from Extreme Programming, they instituted a
    distributed, automatic testing system that kicks in every night
    on the changes submitted to the project that day.</p>

    <p>Another example is NetBeans where from the beginning Sun
    assigned human-computer interaction (HCI) experts,
    documentation writers, product managers, release engineers, and
    quality assurance people to work on it. These folks were
    trained in what open-source development was like and the ways
    that they would need to adapt, but nevertheless these other
    functions and some of the ways they normally operated within
    Sun were carried over into the project.</p>

    <p>In large part, this book is about hybrid open source.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="philosophical-tenets-of-open-source">
    <h2>Philosophical Tenets of Open Source</h2>

    <p>Understanding the philosophical tenets of open source is
    simpler once you know a little about its cultural history,
    which is about as ancient as anything in electronic
    computing.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="historical-roots-of-open-source">
    <h2>Historical Roots of Open Source</h2>

    <p>The open-source philosophy has its roots in the era of
    timesharing at large research universities such as MIT,
    Stanford, and CMU. In the 1960s and 1970s, these schools had
    research laboratories whose researchers and projects produced
    software--this included basic platforms such as operating
    systems and programming languages as well as higher-level,
    application-type software. This was necessary because either
    the research work itself was in the area of operating systems
    and programming languages or there were no suitable commercial
    or &quot;professionally&quot; created systems filling these
    roles.</p>

    <p>The computers these labs used were almost exclusively
    timeshared machines, with a limited number of terminals
    connected to them. During the day, the machine was heavily used
    not only for research but also for writing papers and for
    administrative and clerical purposes. Yes, there was email in
    the 1960s. Imagine a 1 MIP machine with about a megabyte of
    memory shared by 100-200 people. A lot of real work was done at
    night.</p>

    <p>In a typical corporate office at that time, doors were
    normally locked at night and the only people wandering the
    halls were the janitors, who had keys to every office.
    Terminals were usually in offices, and if those offices were
    locked, the terminals were not available for use by anyone
    without a key. Almost certainly there were fewer terminals than
    people, and so the physical resources were shared as well as
    the computational ones. It was assumed that work took place
    during business hours and that the computational resources
    either sat idle at night or were running under the control of
    specific authorized individuals. After all, the computers were
    expensive and were required for the proper operation of the
    company.</p>

    <p>Imagine if this were also true of university research labs.
    People could start large computations and head home,
    experimental operating systems might crash, experimental
    computations might crash the operating system--in short, things
    could get wedged easily. Moreover, there could be more people
    wishing to work than available terminals in unlocked areas and
    offices.</p>

    <p>Suppose it's the 1960s and the terminal controlling an
    out-of-control computation is behind a locked door and the
    problem is sufficient to hamper other people working at 2 am.
    What can you do? Suppose there is no way to kill or suspend the
    computation except by accessing the controlling terminal? Must
    everyone go home until the one person returns the next day?
    Time is too valuable, and there might be 50 people who would
    have to go home because one person has locked his or her door.
    Or suppose the operating system has crashed in such a way that
    even rebooting wouldn't fix it--the permanent context has been
    changed enough that the operating system software needs to be
    fixed (perhaps a new peripheral has been added, such as a robot
    arm). Do you wait until you can talk to the programmer in
    charge to make the change when you yourself are sufficiently
    expert to fix things?</p>

    <p>No, you institute three changes from normal procedures:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You do not allow offices to be locked.</li>

      <li>You create mechanisms for attaching a different terminal
      to an existing session.</li>

      <li>You permit anyone to work on any of the source
      files.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This would be horrifying by some standards, but it worked
    just fine and created a culture that had very high
    productivity. First, rather than having a single or several
    system administrators (sys admins), such labs developed quite a
    few homegrown sys admins, perhaps a few dozen for a 200-person
    lab. These folks could do most anything sys admins do today,
    and in addition they were pretty darn good system
    programmers--typically for each part of the operating system or
    other system software there would be one or two experts who had
    created it and another three to six who were competent enough
    to maintain and improve it. People who joined the lab had all
    the source code available to look at how things were done and,
    in fact, to learn how to program well. What better way to learn
    about programming than by studying the working code of master
    programmers?</p>

    <p>The result was that the machines were productively used 24
    hours a day, 365 (or 366) days a year, with support. Operating
    systems, programming languages, and a lot of the software we
    take for granted today were developed incrementally over a few
    years' time with the full-time or part-time help of hundreds of
    programmers.</p>

    <p>Social pressure and a kind of hierarchy of merit was used as
    a filter on who could work on what. Vandalism, bad behavior,
    and harmful mischievousness rarely, if ever, took place, such
    was the strength of the code of ethics that developed in such
    installations.</p>

    <p>Here's a story we heard from the old days--it may not be
    true in its details, but its essence is accurate:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>A new faculty member joined one of the
      &quot;open-source-like&quot; labs and had a terminal in his
      office. Used to a more traditional environment, he started a
      job, locked the door, and went home for the night. The job
      ran away and locked up the system in such a way it needed to
      be killed from the terminal or the system would need to be
      rebooted. One of the system programmers had to break open the
      door, pulling the hinges out of the door jamb. The next
      morning the new faculty member found his door leaning against
      the wall, splinters all over the floor, a note on his seat
      explaining what happened, and another note from the director
      of the lab informing him that his unrestricted funds account
      would be charged to have the door and jamb repaired.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This is the culture from which the open-source movement
    emerged. The attitude is that people will behave well and that
    there is a common good being promoted. Source code is part of a
    shared experience that builds and supports the culture.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="warning">
    <h2>Warning</h2>

    <p>Therefore, if as you read the following tenets you feel that
    they don't match how you work, how you feel, and how you could
    work, then you will not be able to fit into the culture
    required to make a successful open-source project. In that
    case, you should not pursue open-sourcing your project: Your
    project will not succeed, your project will embarrass your
    company in the public eye, and you will have mangled your
    project in such a way that you will have to abandon it.</p>

    <p>Harsh, yes, but open source is not for everyone or for every
    project--at least not yet.</p>

    <p>Let's look at some of the tenets of open source.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="everyone-together-is-smarter-than-your-group-alone">
    <h2>Everyone Together Is Smarter than Your Group Alone</h2>

    <p>When a producer puts on a play, audience members have no
    choice but to assume the role of critic: either you like the
    play or you don't, and you tell your friends what you think.
    But if the playwright were to turn to potential audience
    members at some point while writing the play and ask for help,
    these potential audience members would probably try their best
    to help and at some point might assume (in their own minds) a
    co-author role. It's harder for a co-author to be as harshly
    critical as a critic.</p>

    <p>Inviting people to look at source code puts them in a frame
    of mind to help out. Not only will you gain a lot of testers,
    but these testers will have the source code and many of them
    will be able to locate the source of a problem in the code
    itself. The sum total of people running the software will
    encompass a wide variety of experience and expertise, and it is
    not unreasonable to assume that every type of bug in your code
    has been seen by someone in the pool at one time or another.
    It's like having a thousand people proofread a book for
    spelling and typographic errors.</p>

    <p>You will mostly get highly informed and dedicated testers.
    The fact that the source code is available means that many of
    them will be at least able to develop their own workarounds to
    problems, and so they will stick with the software longer. But
    just as important, you will get a number of people who will
    want to contribute, often substantially, to the core source
    code.</p>

    <p>A very common reaction to the idea of someone outside the
    organization contributing to the code base is that you don't
    want &quot;a bunch of losers messing things up.&quot; Our
    experience is the opposite. First, there is no requirement in
    open source that every change proposed by someone must be taken
    back into the main source branch. So, you can select what you
    take, and you can modify or improve it if you wish. Second, it
    is your decision whether someone is trusted enough to check
    things directly into the source tree. You will have developed a
    relationship with all these people, looked at their work, and
    worked with them to improve their skills and use the style you
    want and, in most cases you will wish you could hire them.
    Third, there will not be that many of them anyway. For Linux,
    which is the biggest open-source project, there are on the
    order of 100 people who are permitted to check code into the
    source tree without supervision. Many of these people
    &quot;own&quot; parts of the code or modules, and they
    supervise other contributors. Fourth, almost all of the people
    who have access to the source code will be able to identify and
    perhaps isolate problems, and this will make things easier on
    the developers. In fact, most people will hesitate to mess
    things up and will simply report problems.</p>

    <p>The phrase &quot;innovation happens elsewhere&quot; is based
    on the observation that not all the smart people work for you.
    But suppose they do: Suppose that <em>all</em> the people out
    there are losers when it comes to your project and its
    software. What will you do if one of your developers becomes
    ill or leaves your company? Any replacement will have to come
    from this pool of losers. Do you really believe you are in this
    position? Better have excellent health benefits, fabulous
    compensation packages, and bodyguards for your developers.</p>
  </div>

  <div id=
  "open-source-requires-an-open-development-process--starting-with-the-design">
  <h2>Open Source Requires an Open Development Process--Starting
  with the Design</h2>

    <p>It might be tempting to think that open source is really
    just about making the source code available for viewing. If you
    drop code into a public location and continue development on a
    private copy inside your company, you are not doing open
    source. You are running a source access program or simply
    providing extra documentation. To develop the right level of
    trust, the code out there must be the real source code that
    your developers are working on. You might have various modules
    checked out while the code is being worked on, but that must be
    true on a module-by-module basis not the entire source
    base.</p>

    <p>Moreover, your developers are simply part of the larger pool
    of developers. They are perhaps better focused, they might work
    together better, or they might have goals of importance to your
    company, but they are otherwise in exactly the same boat as all
    the outside developers.</p>

    <p>This means also that many, if not all, of what would
    otherwise be internal development mailing lists need to be
    public. All design and implementation decisions that affect the
    public source code must be done in the open. There can be no
    distinction between us and them.</p>

    <p>In exchange for this, you build incredible loyalty and an
    intense desire to move the code forward with a shared vision.
    You get immediate and totally relevant feedback from the
    market. If you are short of resources, perhaps they will be
    supplied from the outside. The highly influential book on
    people management <em>Peopleware</em> (by Tom DeMarco and
    Timothy Lister) suggests that a good way to build a team is to
    have an introductory shared project, where the project itself
    comes to symbolize the group. Perhaps it's getting your newly
    assembled team together to cook an impromptu meal, but in the
    end it's working a shared artifact that does the trick. It's
    the same trick here. But it's no trick, it is part of the
    social nature of people.</p>
  </div>

  <div id=
  "the-business-model-must-reinforce-the-open-source-effort">
    <h2>The Business Model Must Reinforce the Open-source
    Effort</h2>

    <p>You cannot charge people to use code that they are writing
    or have written. That means that you cannot simply take the
    code and charge money directly for it. You need to choose a
    business model that supports open source. The following are
    some classic open-source business models:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Bundle open-source software with perhaps some other
      software and with support, charging for the bundle and for
      additional testing and quality.</li>

      <li>Add value in the form of additional modules or
      surrounding software and sell that additional software
      bundled with the open-source software.</li>

      <li>Provide a service based on the open-source software, such
      as a subscription service that updates customers' sites with
      tested and assured code.</li>

      <li>Sell consulting services that leverage the open-source
      software.</li>

      <li>Sell ancillary things such as books, T-shirts, and
      mugs.</li>

      <li>Sell hardware that runs the open-source software
      particularly well.</li>

      <li>Sell software that uses the open-source software as a
      platform.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are two more business models that apply if you own the
    copyright to all of the source code and expect mostly minimal
    contributions from outside developers.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Release the software as open source, but license the
      software to companies that wish to use it in a proprietary
      product.</li>

      <li>Sell the newest version, but release the previous version
      as open source.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Ubiquity, winning over hearts, thousands of eyes looking
    over the code, better platform security, and getting additional
    outside help are some of the reasons to do open source. The
    classic case is that you need to make a platform ubiquitous for
    some other business reason, and so you use open source as the
    conduit to ubiquity.</p>
  </div>

  <div id=
  "creating-and-involving-outside-developers-requires-internal-resources">
  <h2>Creating and Involving Outside Developers Requires Internal
  Resources</h2>

    <p>Many people think doing open source is a no-brainer: You can
    add developers to your team and don't need to pay them.
    However, you do need to attract, foster, and support those
    outside developers, and that does require internal resources.
    First and foremost, it requires that your internal developers
    take the time to participate on the public mailing lists,
    answer questions from outside developers, and promptly respond
    to bug fixes and code contributions. Your developers also need
    to document the system architecture so outside folks can find
    their way around in the source code. You may even need to
    rewrite the source code to be more modular, especially if it is
    currently one big monolithic mess.</p>

    <p>Another cost is setting up and maintaining the
    infrastructure needed for an open-source project: a CVS code
    archive, a bug database, various mailing lists, and a website
    for the project. For large projects, these can each require a
    full-time person.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="open-source-is-a-gift-economy">
    <h2>Open Source Is a Gift Economy</h2>

    <p>To understand open source, it helps to make a distinction
    between a <em>commodity economy</em> , to which we are
    accustomed in a capitalist society, and a <em>gift economy</em>
    . In a gift economy, gifts are exchanged, forming a bond based
    on mutual obligation: In the simplest form of gift exchange,
    when one person gives a gift to another, the receiver becomes
    obligated to the giver, but not in a purely mercenary
    way--rather, the recipient becomes very much like a member of
    the giver's family where mutual obligations are many, varied,
    and long lasting. A person may give a gift with the realistic
    expectation that someday a gift of equal or greater use value
    will be received or that the recipient will pass on a further
    gift. In an open-source project, the gift of source code is
    reciprocated by suggestions, bug reports, debugging, hard work,
    praise, and more source code.</p>

    <p>The commodity economy depends on scarcity. Its most famous
    law is that of &quot;diminishing returns,&quot; whose working
    requires a fixed supply. Scarcity of material or scarcity of
    competitors creates high profit margins. It works through
    competition.</p>

    <p>The gift economy is an economy of abundance--the gifts
    exchanged are inexhaustible. Gift economies are embedded within
    noneconomic institutions such as kinship, marriage,
    hospitality, artistic patronage, and ritual friendship. A
    healthy Western family operates on a gift economy. In an
    open-source project, the status and reputation of individuals
    depend on the quality of the gifts they contribute.</p>

    <p>For open source to succeed in communities that include
    corporations, the source-code gift-based economy needs to
    thrive alongside the commodity economy just beyond its
    boundaries.</p>

  <div id="the-work-in-progress-effect">
    <h2>The Work-In-Progress Effect</h2>

    <p>The concept of the gift economy is related to what we call
    the <em>work-in-progress</em> effect. This effect is one of the
    primary reasons that writers' workshops in the literary and
    software-patterns worlds work as well as they do. The act of
    opening the curtain early when there is still time to affect
    the outcome seems to elicit a profound response from the
    audience, and the response is heightened when the invitation is
    to be, essentially, co-authors. Harsh criticism is replaced by
    constructive criticism. Responsibility becomes jointly held.
    The co-authors align in their regard for the work, although
    their individual opinions about what to do may differ quite a
    bit. The concern becomes how to make the work the best it can
    be rather than commenting on the work or the author.</p>

    <p>Open source depends on this response.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="open-source-is-not-business-as-usual">
    <h2>Open Source Is Not Business as Usual</h2>

    <p>In summary, deciding to make a project open source means
    that it will be very different from your normal proprietary
    project. All decisions and design will need to be done in the
    open. Schedules will depend on people outside your company whom
    you cannot control. The community that emerges will take on a
    life of its own, possibly taking the project in directions you
    neither anticipated nor desire.</p>

    <p>Your business model and processes must be different or else
    you won't succeed. You don't do open source as an add-on to
    your usual process. Deciding to do open source is like deciding
    to get married and start a family: It takes a commitment, and
    once you start down that path it will change how you live.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="open-source-and-agile-methodologies">
    <h2>Open Source and Agile Methodologies</h2>

    <p>During the last 5 years, a set of methodologies have become
    popular, called <em>agile methodologies</em> . An agile
    methodology is, in general, one that emphasizes incremental
    development and small design steps guided by frequent
    interactions with customers. The customer and developers get
    together and agree on the next set of features and capabilities
    for the software. Ideally, the work should take at most a few
    weeks. The developers then make the additions and the software
    is released to the customers, who react to it, perhaps making
    corrective suggestions.</p>

    <p>Agile methodologies and open source would seem, at first
    glance, to be radically different: Agile methodologies are
    thought of as being about small, collocated teams and open
    source as being about large, distributed ones. A company might
    expect that the benefits of one are pretty different from the
    benefits of the other. Agile methodologies arose, largely, from
    the ranks of paid consultants, whereas open source seems like a
    hippie phenomenon. A company might, therefore, believe there is
    a sharp choice to be made between them, but the choice has more
    to do with the conversations, the diversity of participants,
    and the transparency of the process to the outside world than
    it does with the philosophy of design and development: The two
    approaches share many principles and values.</p>

    <p>Some agile methodologies have special practices that set
    them apart from others--for example, extreme programming uses
    pair programming and test-driven development. Pair programming
    is the practice of two people sitting at the same computer
    screen with one person typing and the other observing and
    commenting. Instead of one person sitting alone with his or her
    thoughts, pair programmers engage in a conversation while
    working, which serves as a real-time continuous design and code
    review. Test-driven development is the practice of defining and
    implementing testing code before the actual product code is
    implemented. The following are the agile development principles
    taken from the Agile Manifesto website<sup><a href="#fn4"
    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4" name="fnref4">4</a></sup>
    --most of these principles also apply to open source, except as
    noted.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>&quot;Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
      through early and continuous delivery of valuable
      software.&quot;</em></li>

      <li>Open source does not talk about the customer, but in
      general, open-source projects do nightly builds and frequent
      named releases, mostly for the purpose of in-situ
      testing.</li>

      <li><em>&quot;Welcome changing requirements, even late in
      development. Agile processes harness change for the
      customer's competitive advantage.&quot;</em></li>

      <li>Open-source projects resist major changes as time goes
      on, but there is always the possibility of forking a project
      if such changes strike enough developers as worthwhile.</li>

      <li><em>&quot;Deliver working software frequently, from a
      couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to
      the shorter time scale.&quot;</em></li>

      <li>Open source delivers working code every night, usually,
      and an open-source motto is &quot;release early, release
      often.&quot;</li>

      <li><em>&quot;Business people and developers must work
      together daily throughout the project.&quot;</em></li>

      <li>Open-source projects don't have a concept of a
      businessperson with whom they work, but users who participate
      in the project serve the same role.</li>

      <li><em>&quot;Build projects around motivated individuals.
      Give them the environment and support they need, and trust
      them to get the job done.&quot;</em></li>

      <li>All open-source projects do this, almost by definition.
      If there is no motivation to work on a project, a developer
      won't. That is, open-source projects are purely voluntary,
      which means that motivation is guaranteed. Open-source
      projects use a set of agreed-on tools for version control,
      compilation, debugging, bug and issue tracking, and
      discussion.</li>

      <li><em>&quot;The most efficient and effective method of
      conveying information to and within a development team is
      face-to-face conversation.&quot;</em></li>

      <li>Open source differs most from agile methodologies here.
      Open-source projects value written communication over
      face-to-face communication. On the other hand, open-source
      projects can be widely distributed, and don't require
      collocation.</li>

      <li><em>&quot;Working software is the primary measure of
      progress.&quot;</em></li>

      <li>This is in perfect agreement with open source.</li>

      <li><em>&quot;Agile processes promote sustainable
      development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be
      able to maintain a constant pace
      indefinitely.&quot;</em></li>

      <li>Although this uses vocabulary that open-source developers
      would not use, the spirit of the principle is embraced by
      open source.</li>

      <li><em>&quot;Continuous attention to technical excellence
      and good design enhances agility.&quot;</em></li>

      <li>Open source is predicated on technical excellence and
      good design.</li>

      <li><em>&quot;Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of
      work not done--is essential.&quot;</em></li>

      <li>Open-source developers would agree that simplicity is
      essential, but open-source projects also don't have to worry
      quite as much about scarcity as agile projects do. There are
      rarely contractually committed people on open-source
      projects--certainly not the purely voluntary ones--so the
      amount of work to be done depends on the beliefs of the
      individual developers.</li>

      <li><em>&quot;The best architectures, requirements, and
      designs emerge from self-organizing teams.&quot;</em></li>

      <li>Possibly open-source developers would not state things
      this way, but the nature of open-source projects depends on
      this being true.</li>

      <li><em>&quot;At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
      to become more effective, and then tunes and adjusts its
      behavior accordingly.&quot;</em></li>

      <li>This is probably not done much in open-source projects,
      although as open-source projects mature, they tend to develop
      a richer set of governance mechanisms. For example, Apache
      started with a very simple governance structure similar to
      that of Linux and now there is the Apache Software Foundation
      with management, directors, and officers. This represents a
      sort of reflection, and almost all community projects evolve
      their mechanisms over time.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In short, both the agile and open-source methodologies
    embrace a number of principles and values, which share the
    ideas of trying to build software suited especially to a class
    of users, interacting with those users during the design and
    implementation phases, blending design and implementation,
    working in groups, respecting technical excellence, doing the
    job with motivated people, and generally engaging in continuous
    (re)design.</p>

    <p>A good example of a company-related open-source project that
    embraces both open-source and agile values is the Visualization
    ToolKit (VTK), which is partly sponsored by GE. VTK is a
    software system for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and
    visualization, and portions of it are subject to patents held
    by GE and a smaller company called Kitware. As its website
    states:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>VTK supports a wide variety of visualization algorithms
      including scalar, vector, tensor, texture, and volumetric
      methods; and advanced modeling techniques such as implicit
      modelling, polygon reduction, mesh smoothing, cutting,
      contouring, and Delaunay triangulation. In addition, dozens
      of imaging algorithms have been directly integrated to allow
      the user to mix 2D imaging/3D graphics algorithms and data.
      The design and implementation of the library has been
      strongly influenced by object oriented principles. VTK has
      been installed and tested on nearly every Unix-based
      platform, PCs (Windows 98/ME/NT/2000/XP), and Mac OS X Jaguar
      or later.<sup><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"
      name="fnref5">5</a></sup></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The kit is substantial, encompassing over 600 C++ classes
    and around half a million lines of code. There are over 2000
    people on the VTK mailing list. GE's stance regarding VTK as a
    commercial advantage is summed up in the following statement:
    &quot;We don't sell VTK, we sell what we do with
    VTK.&quot;<sup><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"
    name="fnref6">6</a></sup> GE has a number of internal and
    external customers of the toolkit--it is used in a variety of
    projects GE is involved with. Kitware provides professional
    services associated with VTK.</p>

    <p>As an open-source project, VTK is a bit unusual, and this is
    the result of some of its principals being involved with GE,
    which is the prime supporter of a design and implementation
    methodology called <em>six sigma</em> . Six sigma refers to a
    statistic that states that a manufactured artifact is 99.99966%
    defect-free, and it also refers to a process in which factors
    important to the customers' perception of quality are
    identified and systematically addressed during a design and
    implementation cycle whose steps are Define, Measure, Analyze,
    Improve, Control (DMAIC). Open source involves the possibility
    of diverse innovations and also provides opportunities for
    interacting with customers in a direct way, which is appealing
    to an organization focused on customers, but there is also the
    possibility of erratic results when there is not a strong,
    explicit emphasis on quality that can be enforced. Therefore,
    open source went only part of the way to satisfying GE's goals
    for quality.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the original VTK implementation team was small and
    dispersed within GE, and its members were admittedly not
    software engineers. The open-source component added to this the
    need to find a way to handle quality. The solution was to adopt
    some of the practices of Extreme Programming, which is one of
    the agile methodologies. Extreme Programming (or XP) emphasizes
    testing and advocates a practice called test-driven design in
    which tests are written at the same time as, or before, the
    code is designed and written.<sup><a href="#fn7" class=
    "footnoteRef" id="fnref7" name="fnref7">7</a></sup> Writing
    tests first has the effect of providing a sort of formal
    specification--the test code--as well as a set of tests to be
    used for regression and integration testing. XP calls for
    frequent (tested) releases, and VTK combines this with the
    open-source practice of &quot;release early, release
    often&quot; to do nightly, fully tested builds.</p>

    <p>The VTK developers implemented a regimen in which submitted
    code is tested overnight using a large corpus of regression
    tests, image regression tests (comparing program output to a
    gold standard), statistical performance comparisons, style
    checks, compilation, error log analyses, and memory leak and
    bounds-check analyses; the software's documentation is
    automatically produced; and the result is a quality dashboard
    that is displayed every day on the website. The dashboard is
    similar to those produced by the Mozilla project,<sup><a href=
    "#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8" name=
    "fnref8">8</a></sup> but considerably more detailed. The tests
    are run on around 50 different builds on a variety of platforms
    across the Internet, and distributions are made for all the
    platforms.</p>

    <p>The reasons for this approach, as stated by the original
    team, are as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>To shorten the software engineering life cycle of
      design/implement/test to a granularity of 1 day.</li>

      <li>To make software that always works.</li>

      <li>To find and fix defects in hours not weeks by bringing
      quality assurance inside the development cycle and by
      breaking the cycle of letting users find bugs.</li>

      <li>To automate everything.</li>

      <li>To make all developers responsible for testing
      (developers are expected to fix their bugs immediately).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Among the values expressed by the original development team
    are the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Test early and often; this is critical to high-quality
      software.</li>

      <li>Retain measurements to assess progress and measure
      productivity.</li>

      <li>Present results in concise informative ways.</li>

      <li>Know and show the status of the system at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is not all. The VTK website provides excellent
    documentation and a coding style guide with examples. Most of
    the details of the mechanics of the code are spelled out in
    detail. Moreover, there are several textbooks available on
    VTK.</p>

    <p>In short, the VTK open-source project has integrated
    open-source and extreme-programming practices to satisfy GE's
    need to express to customers its commitment to quality, even in
    projects only partially controlled by GE. Furthermore, GE has
    tapped into a larger development community to assist its own
    small team, so that its customers get the benefits of a
    high-functionality, high-quality system infused with GE
    values.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="continuous-redesign">
    <h2>Continuous (Re)design</h2>

    <p>The primary source of similarities between open-source and
    the agile methodologies is their shared emphasis on continuous
    (re)design. Continuous design is the idea that design and
    building are intertwined and that changes to a design should be
    made as more is learned about the true requirements for the
    software. This is why both camps agree with the mantra,
    &quot;release early, release often.&quot;</p>

    <p>Continuous design is an approach that is predicated on
    recognizing that it is rarely possible to design perfectly
    upfront. The realization is that design is often the result of
    slowly dawning insights rather than of knowing everything at
    the start of the project and that, like most projects, the
    activities are progressive and uncertain. Specifications of
    software function, usability, and structure, for example,
    cannot be fully known before software is designed and
    implemented. In continuous design, software source code, bug
    databases, and archived online discussions capture and track
    the preferences and realities of co-emerging software systems
    and their user/developer communities in a continuous cycle of
    innovation, change, and design. Explicit and formal
    specifications and formal design processes rarely exist: The
    code itself along with the archived discussions are the
    specification.</p>

    <p>Some open-source projects, especially hybrid
    company/volunteer projects, use more formal processes and
    produce more formal artifacts such as specifications, but even
    these projects accept the idea that the design should change as
    the requirements are better understood. In fact, we could argue
    that even software produced using the current principles of
    software design, software engineering, and software evolution
    are often discretized versions of continuous design--imposing
    the idea of formal design and specifications done largely
    upfront, but (unconsciously) allowing the effect of continuous
    design over a series of infrequent major releases rather than
    through small, essentially daily ones.</p>

  <div id="common-open-source-myths-misconceptions-and-questions">
    <h2>Common Open-Source Myths, Misconceptions, and
    Questions</h2>

    <p>The picture of open-source software painted by the popular
    media tends to be superficial and simplistic. Open source is
    touted as a miraculous way to produce software at no cost. For
    anyone developing software professionally, all this open-source
    hype no doubt seems pretty farfetched. Let's take a closer look
    and try to shed some light on what open source is really all
    about.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="myth-1:-open-source-development-is-something-new">
    <h2>Myth 1: Open-Source Development is Something New</h2>

    <p>If you read the newspaper, open source seems to have started
    with the Linux operating system back in 1991 (or more likely,
    in 1997 or 1998 when whoever wrote the article finally heard
    about Linux). The actual facts are a bit different: Open source
    is as old as computer programming. If you had wandered into
    places such as MIT or Stanford in the 1960s, you would have
    seen that sharing software source code was assumed. Early
    development of the ARPAnet was helped by freely available
    source code, a practice that continued as it grew into today's
    Internet. The Berkeley version of Unix dates from the
    mid-1970s. All in all quite a distinguished lineage.</p>

    <p>The creation of software by a loosely coupled group of
    volunteers seems a thoroughly contemporary phenomenon, based on
    the free outlook of the 1960s--a kind of fallout of free love
    and hippiedom--but the concept of distributed group development
    is hardly new.</p>

    <p>On Guy Fawkes Day, 1857, Richard Chenevix Trench, addressing
    the Philological Society, proposed the production of a new,
    complete English dictionary based on finding the earliest
    occurrences of each of the English words ever in printed use.
    That is, the dictionary would be constructed by reading every
    book ever written and noting down exactly where in each book a
    significant use of every word occurred; these citations would
    be used to write definitions and short histories of the words'
    uses. In order to do this, Trench proposed enlisting the
    volunteer assistance of individuals throughout English-speaking
    countries by advertising for their assistance.</p>

    <p>Over a period of 70 years, many hundreds of people sent in
    over 6 million slips with words and their interesting
    occurrences in thousands of books. This resulted in the
    <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> , the ultimate authority on
    English, with 300,000 words, about 2.5 million citations, and
    8.3 citations per entry in 20 volumes.</p>

    <p>Compare this with the best effort by an individual--Samuel
    Johnson, over a 9-year period, using the same methodology and a
    handful of assistants called <em>amanuenses</em> , produced a
    two-volume dictionary with about 40,000 words and in most cases
    one citation per entry. As we look at these two works,
    Johnson's dictionary is a monument to individual effort and a
    work of art, revealing as much about Johnson as about the
    language he perceived around him, while the OED is the standard
    benchmark for dictionaries, the final arbiter of meaning and
    etymology.</p>
  </div>

  <div id=
  "myth-2:-open-source-development-is-done-by-hobbyists-and-students">
  <h2>Myth 2: Open-Source Development Is Done by Hobbyists and
  Students</h2>

    <p>The stereotype for the sort of person who contributes to an
    open-source project is that of a hobbyist or student, someone
    you perhaps wouldn't take too seriously. After all, full-time
    professional programmers don't have time for such things. Well,
    first, students and hobbyists can often write very good code.
    Next, lots of professionals do like to program on their own
    time. A study done by the Boston Consulting Group<sup><a href=
    "#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9" name=
    "fnref9">9</a></sup> found that over 45% of those participating
    in open-source projects were experienced, professional
    programmers, with another 20% being sys admins, IT managers, or
    academics. The same study found that over 30% of these
    professionals were paid by their day job to develop open-source
    software. Both Sun and IBM have engineering teams contributing
    to various parts of the Apache web server. Most companies
    building PC peripherals now write the needed device drivers for
    Linux as well as Windows. In fact, the open-source process
    encourages the replacement of contributions from less capable
    programmers with code from more capable ones.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="myth-3:-open-source-software-is-low-quality">
    <h2>Myth 3: Open-Source Software Is Low Quality</h2>

    <p>How can a bunch of random programmers, with no quality
    assurance (QA) folks, produce code with any degree of quality?
    Isn't open-source software full of bugs? Well, there may
    initially be as many bugs in open source as in proprietary
    code, but because it's open more developers will actually look
    at the code, catching many bugs in the process. Also everyone
    using the code is essentially doing QA; they report on any bugs
    that they find, and because they have access to the source
    code, they often also fix the bugs themselves.</p>

    <p>In 2003, Reasoning, Inc., performed a defect
    analysis<sup><a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"
    name="fnref10">10</a></sup> of the Apache web server and
    Tomcat, which is a mechanism for extending Apache with Java
    servlets, by using their defect discovery tool. For Apache, the
    tool found 31 defects in 58,944 source lines, a defect density
    of 0.53 defects per thousand lines of source code (KSLC). In a
    sampling of 200 projects totaling 35 million lines of code, 33%
    had a defect density below 0.36 defects/KSLC, 33% had a defect
    density between 0.36 and 0.71 defects/KSLC, and the remaining
    33% had a defect density above 0.71 defects/KSLC. This puts
    Apache squarely in the middle of the studied quality
    distribution. For Tomcat, the tool found 17 software defects in
    70,988 lines of Tomcat source code. The defect density of the
    Tomcat code inspected was 0.24 defects/KSLC. This puts Tomcat
    in the upper half of quality.</p>

    <p>If you still don't believe that open-source software is of
    similar quality to most commercial software, just take a look
    at some open-source software you use every day. Assuming you
    make any use of the Internet, you are relying on open-source
    code such as BIND, which is at the heart of the Domain Name
    Service (DNS); or sendmail, which probably transports most
    email; and Apache, which as of February 2004 was the software
    running on over 67% of the world's web servers. Then there's
    Linux, which has won several awards for quality and has a
    notably longer mean time between reboots than some other major
    PC operating systems.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="myth-4:-large-scale-development-isnt-efficient">
    <h2>Myth 4: Large-Scale Development Isn't Efficient</h2>

    <p>Having thousands of people fixing bugs might work, but how
    can you possibly coordinate the work of that number of
    developers? Without central control how can it possibly be an
    efficient process? Well, that's correct, but why does it need
    to be efficient? When you have limited resources, efficiency is
    important, but in an open-source effort with lots of
    developers, if some go off and write a module that eventually
    is rejected, it doesn't matter. Open-source efforts often
    progress in small steps. If several people are working on
    different solutions to a problem, as long as one eventually
    produces a solution, you are making forward progress. If two
    solutions are produced, that's even better: just pick the best
    one. Also, with the ease of email and news groups, the various
    people working on the problem will probably find each other and
    spontaneously self-organize to work together to produce a
    result that is better than any of them alone could have
    produced--all without any central control.</p>

  <h2>Myth 5: If the Software Is Free, then Who's Going to Pay You
  to Write It?</h2>

    <p>Why should your company pay you to write free software?
    Well, your company may already be doing that. Are you working
    on a product that is sold or distributed for free? Are you
    working on something only used internally? Is the income
    generated from selling the software you write greater than the
    cost to produce it? The profit may come from other activities.
    Likewise for free software. Your company will continue to make
    its money from selling hardware (e.g., servers, storage, and
    workstations); proprietary software; books; and consulting,
    training, and support.</p>

    to pay the main Perl developers to work on new Perl features.

    which makes its money by packaging up free software. Cygnus
    (now part of Red Hat) sells support for the GNU compiler and
    debugger, which its employees continue to develop and give
    away. Sun sells servers, but gives away Java.</p>

    <p>Look at the sections <sup><a href="#fn11" class=
    "footnoteRef" id="fnref11" name="fnref11">11</a></sup> Our
    belief is that this is a little high, but it isn't too far
    off.</p>

    <p>Another source of data is SourceForge, which has about
    80,000 projects with 90,000 developers. The distribution of the
    number of developers to projects there follows a power law with
    about 60,000 projects with between zero and one active
    developers, 3000 with three, five with 30, and one with 100. To
    factor out the large number of inactive or dead projects on
    SourceForge, a study in May 2002 by Krishnamurthy<sup><a href=
    "#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12" name=
    "fnref12">12</a></sup> looked at participation only in mature,
    active projects and found the average number of developers per
    project to be four. Only 19 out of the 100 projects studied had
    more than 10 developers, whereas 22% of the projects had only
    one developer associated with them.</p>

    <p>It's true that you don't need to pay any outside developers
    who choose to work on your project. However you do need to pay
    the cost of maintaining the infrastructure necessary for
    open-source development (e.g., a CVS code server, a bug
    database, project mailing lists, and project website), along
    with the people to integrate the contributions you get. You
    won't get something for nothing, but for a successful
    open-source project you can get back more than what you put
    in.</p>

  <div id="myth-7:-open-source-doesnt-scale">
    <h2>Myth 7: Open Source Doesn't Scale</h2>

    <p>Experience with conventional, proprietary software
    development teaches that the larger the project, the greater
    the number of resources needed for coordination and design. For
    an open-source project where all the discussion is via mailing
    lists and where there is no formal management structure, it
    seems that it would be impossible to efficiently organize the
    developers. Hence, open source might work for small projects,
    but not for large ones.</p>

    <p>In his essay, <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em> , Frederick P.
    Brooks states that adding more developers to a late project
    will just make it later. In an open-source project, developers
    can be added at any time with no forewarning. One issue with
    Brooks' Law and the various studies that have subsequently
    either supported or qualified it is that there is a tacit
    assumption about the development process. Although rarely
    stated, the assumption is that the development team will be
    made up of individual contributors, each working on a separate
    part of the software, forming an efficient allocation of
    developers to the code. As it turns out, neither extreme
    programming nor open source obeys that assumption. Moreover,
    these studies assume that developers are a scarce resource,
    which is not true for open source.</p>

    <p>Although it has been difficult to set up proper experiments
    to test how extreme programming affects Brooks' Law, one
    preliminary study<sup><a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id=
    "fnref13" name="fnref13">13</a></sup> showed that when a
    programmer was added to create a pair-programming situation,
    the added programmer could immediately contribute by observing
    and pointing out simple errors and by asking probing questions
    that served to clarify the thought processes of the primary
    programmer. Thus, the new programmer could be productive
    immediately, although not as productive as a full-speed
    developer. The difficulty in experimental methodology is to
    obtain a valid comparison between an extreme programming
    project and a traditional one.</p>

    <p>In an open-source project, developers are no longer treated
    as a scarce resource that must be used efficiently. Therefore,
    a developer added to a project doesn't need to have a separate
    part carved out. Moreover, a new developer can probably
    contribute immediately in the same way as in extreme
    programming by finding (and fixing) simple errors and asking
    probing questions. In his essay, Brooks points out that new
    developers must be trained, that larger teams require greater
    overhead to communicate with each other, and that not every
    task may be partitioned.</p>

    <p>For an open-source project, it is important to distinguish
    between those developers who make up the <em>core team</em>
    --the module owners and few developers with check-in
    privileges--and the much larger number of occasional
    contributors. The core team is always going to be too small and
    all the lessons of conventional software development apply to
    them, including Brooks' Law. However it is with the larger
    group of contributors that open source changes the rules: These
    are the folks who can track down obscure bugs and create fixes
    for them, help each other to get up to speed on the code,
    implement features from the project's wishlist, or explore and
    experiment with more radical modifications--all activities that
    free up the core team to focus on its own main work.</p>

    <p>Instead of controlling and scheduling developers, open
    source relies on the developers' self-organizing based on their
    interests and abilities. Instead of a management structure to
    coordinate everyone's work, open-source development requires
    resources to evaluate and integrate developer contributions.
    Moreover, those resources can draw on the total community of
    developers and are not limited to any core group. To see this,
    look at the success of some of the large open-source projects
    such as Apache or Linux.</p>

  "myth-8:-a-company-doing-open-source-gives-up-ownership-of-its-source-code-and-patents">
  <h2>Myth 8: A Company Doing Open Source Gives Up Ownership of Its
  Source Code and Patents</h2>

    <p>Your company still owns any source code that it releases
    under an open-source license because your company still owns
    the copyright. The open-source license grants others the right
    to examine and use the source code, but it does not affect your
    company's ownership of the code. As the copyright owner, your
    company can release the source code under another license or
    use it in a proprietary product. Only if the source code were
    distributed containing an explicit disclaimer of copyright
    protection by your company would the software pass to the
    public domain and thereby no longer be owned by your
    company.<sup><a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"
    name="fnref14">14</a></sup></p>

    <p>However, source code contributed back to your company by
    outside developers is owned by the author, who holds the
    copyright for it. Under some licenses, such as the Sun
    Community Source License (SCSL), your company would be able to
    use the contributed code without restrictions. Under an open
    source license, such as GPL or the Mozilla Public License
    (MPL), your company would be bound by the terms of the license
    just like any other developer.</p>

    <p>Similarly, your company still owns the patents embodied in
    any source released under an open-source license, but if your
    company does not explicitly talk about the uses to which any
    such patents may be put, others might be free to use those
    patents.</p>

  <div id="myth-9:-an-open-source-community-is-an-open-community">
    <h2>Myth 9: An Open-Source Community is an Open Community</h2>

    <p>An open-source community is a community surrounding an
    open-source artifact, but it may not be an open community,
    meaning that it might not be open to anyone at all joining, and
    that once in the community a member might not know how to move
    ahead and become a leader. The community can be as closed,
    idiosyncratic, and undemocratic as it wants to be. The license
    guarantees that everyone in the community has certain rights
    with respect to the code, but in general it does not say
    anything about the community.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="open-source-and-community">
    <h2>Open Source and Community</h2>

    <p>A successful open-source project is a community effort by
    people with different needs and skills and includes users,
    designers, programmers, testers, and others. The word
    <em>community</em> encompasses many meanings and is used by
    different people to mean many different things. For
    understanding open source, we find the following definition
    from <em>Community Building on the Web</em> by Amy Jo Kim most
    useful:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>A community is a group of people with a shared interest,
      purpose, or goal, who get to know each other better over
      time. (p. 28)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Both aspects are equally important: Conversations around
    their shared interest in the open-source project cause the
    participants to learn about each other. A scattered collection
    of people just using a piece of software is not a community,
    but can become one by talking with each other to understand how
    to best use the software. We particularly want to distinguish a
    true community from a <em>user group,</em> where people come
    mainly to learn about a product or technology but do not
    interact much with each other--typically the users listen to
    and ask questions of one or more experts.</p>

    <p>If you ask people connected with open source about their
    community and how it works, many will draw something like
    Figure 3.1. They will tell you about how people start as just
    users and how some will become more involved by reporting bugs.
    Some may become developers who fix bugs or make minor
    enhancements. A few developers then get more involved and join
    the ranks of the core developers, being granted the right to
    check-in changes to the actual project's source code. This is a
    very code-centric view of the open-source process as a
    hierarchy that has users at the periphery, occasional
    developers closer in, core developers even closer in, and the
    code at the center.</p>

    <div class="figure">
      <img src="fig3-1.gif" alt=
      "FIGURE 3.1. Single community built around source code.">

      <p class="caption">FIGURE 3.1. Single community built around
      source code.</p>
    </div>

    <p>And, in fact, this view makes the hierarchy into a funnel in
    which the goal is to convert people from one ring in the
    diagram to people in the next one in--almost as if the goal
    were to turn people into code in the end, the highest form of
    existence.</p>

    <p>A direct result of this perspective is that the actual users
    of the program are marginalized. Although the success of the
    project is often measured by the number of people that use the
    computer program being developed, only those people who are
    willing and able to talk about the code can participate in
    discussions on the project's mailing lists. Major decisions are
    made by those writing the code, not by those who will only use
    it.</p>

    <p>If we step back a bit, we can see that the people involved
    in an open-source project take on various roles. Over time they
    may act as users, designers, or coders. So a better diagram
    looks like Figure 3.2. Here the code is still at the center;
    users, designers, and coders can look at the code, but only the
    <em>core coders</em> deal directly with the code. We use the
    term <em>coder</em> rather than <em>developer</em> to emphasize
    the roles being played: A coder is someone who manipulates
    code, either by writing new code to implement some design
    feature or by inspecting and correcting existing code someone
    else has written.</p>

    <p>The thin solid black lines in Figure 3.2 indicate changes to
    the source code, the dotted lines indicate viewing the source
    code and interacting with the program, and the thicker, black
    lines indicate communications between people in the different
    roles. Note that the ovals representing the different roles are
    not drawn to scale; the users' circle should be much, much
    bigger for any healthy open-source project.</p>

    <div class="figure">
      <img src="fig3-2.gif" alt=
      "FIGURE 3.2. Different roles, still focused on code.">

      <p class="caption">FIGURE 3.2. Different roles, still focused
      on code.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This is still a view that focuses on the source code, but it
    brings out that design is separate from coding and that
    designers need not be coders. It also reflects the fact that
    people in the community may not simply advance from user to
    core developer in a linear progression but adopt the roles that
    make sense for what they are doing at the moment.</p>

    <p>If we step back still further and look at all the ways that
    people interact in the context of an open-source project, we
    see they do so in many different ways, such as:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Reading, writing, modifying and debugging the actual
      source code.</li>

      <li>Reporting and commenting on bugs.</li>

      <li>Reading and writing documents such as user manuals,
      tutorials, how-tos, system documentation, and project
      roadmaps.</li>

      <li>Visiting the project's official website or other related
      websites.Participating in online public discussions via
      mailing lists, newsgroups, and IRC chat sessions.</li>

      <li>Attending meetings and conferences such as user groups,
      community meetings, working groups, and trade shows.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Many of these do not involve the source code at all: Users
    can discuss how best to do their jobs, perhaps only just
    touching on how the project's tools can help them. Other
    conversations may focus on standards for protocols or
    application programming interfaces (APIs) that the project
    uses. Still other conversations may address issues affecting
    the larger open-source community. Each different conversation
    involves a different group of people. These groups may range in
    size from small working groups of fewer than 20 members to full
    communities of hundreds or thousands of participating
    individuals. We might represent these multiple communities as
    in Figure 3.3. Some people will participate in different
    discussions, making them members of several communities. This
    overlap helps to create the larger community associated with
    the open-source project as a whole.</p>

    <div class="figure">
      <img src="fig3-3.gif" alt=
      "FIGURE 3.3. Communities built around common interests.">

      <p class="caption">FIGURE 3.3. Communities built around
      common interests.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Each of these communities has its own special interests; for
    example, some communities connected to Linux might include
    system administrators concerned with installing and configuring
    the Linux operating system on various types of computers.
    Another group of people might be concerned with business
    productivity tools (such as word processors, spreadsheets, and
    presentation tools) that are available for Linux--their focus
    is on what tools exist and how to use them. A third community
    might form around computer games available for Linux, with a
    subcommunity around a specific game such as Quake--this group
    would focus on exchanging tips, rumors of new games, and
    finding opponents to play with.</p>

    <p>Each community will flourish or wither depending on how well
    its interests are met by the community resources. For example a
    community of newbies asking basic questions about how to use a
    piece of software will succeed only if more experienced users
    who can answer those questions are also part of the
    community.</p>

    <p>In the course of a successful open-source project, different
    communities will come and go. New ones will spring up, grow,
    and possibly become dormant or die. As long as there are always
    some thriving communities, the larger open-source project can
    be considered alive and well.</p>

    <p>Note that death of a community does not equal failure.
    Consider a community that arises to develop a new standard.
    After the standard it developed has been accepted by the larger
    Internet community, the community has achieved its purpose and
    is no longer necessary. If future revisions to the standard are
    called for, the community might be resurrected.</p>

    <div class="figure">
      <img src="fig3-4.gif" alt=
      "FIGURE 3.4. Different Jini code development interests.">

      <p class="caption">FIGURE 3.4. Different Jini code
      development interests.</p>
    </div>

    <p>A similar situation exists in any large open-source project.
    In Apache, for example, there are smaller subcommunities
    focused on the Apache HTTP Server, the Apache Portable Runtime,
    the Jakarta Project (which includes major efforts such as
    Tomcat, Struts, and Ant), mod_perl, PHP, TCL, and XML (with
    subprojects such as Xerces, Xalan, Batik, and Crimson).</p>

    <p>In addition to communities focused on developing code, other
    Jini-related groups have formed around interests such as
    helping beginners learn Jini, Jini in academia, and even Jini
    marketing and Jini business development. As of spring 2004,
    there were over 150 projects (although some of them seemed to
    be no longer active).</p>

    <p>A characteristic of the Jini community that is not typical
    of other open-source communities is its elaborate governance
    mechanisms. Membership is divided into bodies consisting of
    individuals and companies, called houses. In the General House
    each person has one vote, and in the Commercial House each
    company has one vote; and any major decision requires both
    houses to agree. There is also an appeals board (Technical
    Oversight Committee) for which the General House, the
    Commercial House, and Sun Microsystems each selects three
    members.</p>

    <div class="figure">
      <img src="fig3-5.gif" alt=
      "FIGURE 3.5. Multiple NetBeans products and uses.">

      <p class="caption">FIGURE 3.5. Multiple NetBeans products and
      uses.</p>
    </div>

    <p>There are several distinct user communities. First, there
    are those developers using NetBeans as an IDE to create Java
    applications--their concern is how to best use NetBeans to
    write Java programs. There is also a geographical information
    system (GIS) built using the NetBeans framework--users of that
    application are not involved with any programming; they want to
    discuss issues around using GIS. When the NetBeans IDE is
    enhanced to handle languages in addition to Java, such as
    C/C++, then there will be a new user community of C/C++
    developers.</p>

    <p>Note that in the diagram in Figure 3.5 the oval labeled
    <em>Users</em> should be several orders of magnitude larger
    than all of the other ovals; the users number in the tens or
    hundreds of thousands, whereas the people modifying the
    NetBeans code are in the hundreds.</p>

    <p>For NetBeans to be a success, all of these communities need
    to be successful. Each must grow for NetBeans to prosper.</p>

    <p>NetBeans provides another example of how an open-source
    project can involve multiple communities, in this case three
    very different cultures:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>NetBeans</li>

      <li>Forte</li>

      <li>Sun</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At Sun, the NetBeans open-source project arose from the
    simultaneous acquisitions of NetBeans, a small startup company
    in Prague, Czech Republic, and Forte Software, a company based
    in Oakland, California. These two companies joined Sun's
    existing Tools organization, bringing together three companies,
    with three different corporate cultures, sets of values,
    day-to-day processes, and business goals. This was a
    challenging acquisition integration task.</p>

    <p>Unifying three different corporate cultures and day-to-day
    processes would be challenging enough; however, the bigger
    challenge may have been that the Tools organization was now
    spread across three different sites (Menlo Park, Oakland, and
    Prague). Recall that distributed development is fundamental to
    the open-source methodology. It is simply assumed. So the
    open-source methodology represented both a natural solution for
    the Tools organization's physical distribution and a neutral
    fourth methodology to bridge the differences in corporate
    cultures and processes.</p>

  <div id="the-secret-of-why-open-source-works">
    <h2>The Secret of Why Open Source Works</h2>

    <p>Open source works when a group of people all embrace a set
    of shared goals and establish a community based on mutual
    trust. All three factors--enough interested people, shared
    goals, and trust--are required; if any one is missing, the
    project will fail.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="self-organization-through-shared-goals">
    <h2>Self-Organization through Shared Goals</h2>

    <p>Open-source projects often have hundreds or even thousands
    of people participating in their development. Yet there is no
    formal management structure to coordinate their many and varied
    activities.</p>

    <p>The traditional approach to managing a large group of
    workers has been to establish a strict hierarchy of managers
    controlling the activities of the people below them. Such large
    command-and-control organizations have been the norm in
    business and the military from the Roman legions to General
    Motors. Such organizations pay a big cost in the number of
    people needed as managers, the amount of communications they
    require for coordination, and the rigidity of their response to
    novel situations. A big problem is that people lower down in
    the organization rarely have any idea how what they are told to
    do corresponds to the larger strategy. In fact, according to
    studies reported in the book <em>The Strategy-Focused
    Organization</em> by Robert Kaplan and David Norton, over 90%
    of companies fail to implement their strategy largely because
    the strategy is not communicated properly to the people in the
    company.</p>

    <p>At the second Jini community meeting, Lieutenant General
    (Retired) Paul Van Riper, the former commanding general of the
    Marine Corps Combat Development Command, spoke on how the
    Marine Corps had made a shift from top-down control to policies
    based on self-organization for use in combat. For example,
    instead of a platoon being commanded to capture a hilltop, they
    might now be instructed to set up an observation post on a
    hilltop in order to view enemy troop movements along an
    important roadway. If the initial hill is defended or
    inaccessible, the platoon can choose a neighboring hilltop that
    also satisfies the goal instead. Including the strategic
    purpose as part of each order results in a much more flexible
    and responsive organization. A similar organizational shift in
    the business world was presented by Tom Petzinger at the first
    Jini community meeting--and is the topic of his book <em>The
    New Pioneers</em> .</p>

    <p>Open source takes this self-organization process several
    steps further: Rather than someone high up in the organization
    setting out the goals, the actual people using and developing
    the software discuss on public mailing lists or newsgroups what
    improvements are needed. People propose features or
    capabilities that they want to see added--usually because they
    want to use them themselves. If enough other users and
    developers agree that the feature would be useful, then some of
    them may volunteer to write the code to implement it. However,
    if interest is too low, nothing may happen.</p>

    <p>Sometimes a single developer will care enough about an idea
    to code up a prototype of it, and, if enough people try the
    prototype and like it, it may become part of the official
    project or at least be kept as an option for those who want to
    use it. Note that this type of exploratory development is a
    common aspect of open source. It is a way of introducing new
    goals into the community through demonstration rather than just
    conversation. Some may complain that this is not efficient--the
    developer's effort is wasted if the innovation is
    rejected--but, as with evolution, efficiency is not the point.
    That developer may have had no interest in working on anything
    else aside from the innovation that was rejected and would not
    have worked on other parts of the project. So the work did not
    take away from existing efforts--although if the work had been
    adopted it might have meant that some existing modules would
    have been replaced. Also, even if a particular contribution is
    not incorporated into the project directly, the ideas behind it
    may very well find their way into later contributions.</p>

    <p>Although the overall open-source project may have hundreds
    of participants, there always is a basic core team, usually
    consisting of fewer than 10 developers. With that small a
    group, informal communication suffices to coordinate
    development activities. In fact, the team works pretty much
    like any proprietary software development team does. Two main
    differences are that the open-source core team members are
    almost always geographically dispersed--so they communicate
    mainly via email and chat--and that they get immediate feedback
    from the rest of the community on their decisions.</p>

    <p>For those larger open-source efforts (e.g., Linux, Mozilla,
    NetBeans, and Apache) that have many more dedicated developers,
    the work is divided into separate modules, each with its own
    small core team. This is a good example of Conway's Law--the
    architecture of the code follows the structure of the
    organization. This tendency to keep the code modular gives
    open-source software a flexibility and adaptability that is
    often lost in the more monolithic code produced by proprietary
    companies.</p>

    <p>This pressure for modularization also can be seen in the
    evolution of project mailing lists: Whenever the traffic on a
    list or newsgroup gets too great, the community breaks the
    discussion into subtopics. The separation of the code and the
    associated discussions makes it possible for people with
    limited time to follow and actively participate in the
    project.</p>

    <p>The project mailing lists also show self-organization in how
    questions get answered. For conventional products, companies
    employ people whose job is to answer customer questions.
    Open-source projects do not have such people, and at first
    glance we might expect that the main developers would be
    overwhelmed trying to answer questions from the thousands of
    users. This isn't what happens, however. Instead, the more
    advanced users answer questions from the intermediate users,
    who in turn answer questions from the novices, leaving only the
    extremely sophisticated or difficult queries for the developers
    to reply to.</p>

    <p>Another way open source self-organizes is seen in how bugs
    are identified and fixed. The entire community is constantly
    using, and therefore testing, the software. Each member shares
    the goal of wanting to improve it and so will report problems,
    often locating the code causing the bug and including a
    possible fix. This full testing coverage and repair takes place
    with no coordination required and minimal core-team
    overhead.</p>

    <p>Having common goals brings people into the project and
    through group discussion these goals are refined and developed.
    However, as the project goes forward, if part of the community
    has goals not shared with the rest, then the project may fork.
    For example, when some members of the NetBSD community decided
    that security was a major goal that wasn't being given enough
    emphasis, that group decided to create a new project, OpenBSD,
    that had as its main goal the building of the most secure
    Unix-like operating system.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="trust-enables-cooperation">
    <h2>Trust Enables Cooperation</h2>

    <p>The sharing of goals creates a reason for people to
    participate in the open-source project. To create a true
    community requires trust--trust that your contributions will
    not be scorned and that you won't be made a fool of or taken
    advantage of. When participants show each other mutual respect,
    it becomes possible for them to cooperate. If discussions
    degenerate into flaming and put-downs, if suggestions and
    contributions are laughed at, if decisions are made in an
    arbitrary way, then most folks will go elsewhere and not put
    any energy into the project.</p>

    <p>A classic example of how many open-source projects work to
    build trust is shown by how a new developer acquires the right
    to modify the project's source code. When new developers join a
    project, they need to earn the respect of the current
    developers. They do this by submitting bug fixes and
    modifications and by participating in group discussions. Only
    after demonstrating that they can act responsibly will they be
    granted check-in privileges. Thus, developers know that the
    code they write can be modified only by people they trust;
    their code is safe from anyone who would arbitrarily or
    ignorantly change it.</p>

    <p>Another concern people have is that they be treated fairly.
    Before investing effort into a project, most people want to be
    assured that they will have a voice in any major decisions.
    When decisions flow out of community discussions and represent
    consensus, that process reinforces the sense of community,
    people will be invested in carrying out the necessary work. If
    decisions seem arbitrary or go against their interests, then
    people have no motivation to participate and are apt to leave.
    Many open-source developers worry that a company will decide to
    sponsor an open-source project because it plans to take the
    community's work, package it up in a proprietary product, and
    deny the community access to it. If these fears are not laid to
    rest and the company doesn't earn the community's trust, then
    it will be hard to attract outside developers to work on the
    project and it is even likely that a competing open-source
    project will be created--possibly starting with the very code
    that the company donated.</p>

    <p>It is important to remember that open source is based on a
    gift economy: Participants trust that the gifts they give to
    the project will be returned in kind by other community
    members. It's more like a family than a consortium--individuals
    create relationships with other participants through continuing
    interactions; the relationships that hold the project together
    are person-to-person, not company-to-company.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="achieving-critical-mass-via-the-internet">
    <h2>Achieving Critical Mass Via the Internet</h2>

    <p>The Internet is a major enabler of open-source projects. It
    helps people living all over the globe to find others with
    common interests. Through email, newsgroups, and the Web, these
    people can easily communicate, share code, and coordinate their
    activities. Without the Internet, it would be vastly more
    difficult, if not impossible, to run a successful open-source
    project.</p>

    <p>An open-source project requires people, both users and
    developers. Many open-source projects start with a developer or
    two who have a program that they feel others will find useful.
    They can advertise their application through newsgroups and
    mailing lists, and they can make it available on relevant
    websites. Through the use of search engines and
    special-interest lists, people anywhere in the world can then
    locate and try out programs they might be interested in. People
    who like a program will spread the word. This makes it possible
    for groups to form based on very specialized interests--with
    the whole, networked world to draw on, it's hard to think of a
    topic that won't draw a quorum.</p>

    <p>After finding a program they like, people are able to
    provide feedback to its creator via email and they can also
    discuss issues of using it with other users. The ease with
    which new mailing lists, newsgroups, and websites can be
    created makes electronic discussions both quick and simple.
    Email discussions among a large group of people can be easier
    both to follow and to separate by topics compared to
    face-to-face discussion. Mailing lists also allow the group to
    coordinate future development.</p>

    <p>While the Internet makes it easy for new individuals to find
    an open-source project, whether or not they stay and
    participate will be determined in large part by the project's
    culture--is there a sense of community and trust, or instead is
    it cold, cliquish, and unfriendly? Unlike the business world
    where people assigned to a project are forced to work together,
    with open source, interested potential contributors who do not
    engage with the core developers--because of having a different
    vision or due to incompatible work styles--will probably go
    elsewhere.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="open-source-is-an-evolutionary-process">
    <h2>Open Source Is an Evolutionary Process</h2>

    <p>The open-source process involves small, incremental
    improvements to some artifact, usually the source code for a
    computer program. It is essential that the starting point be a
    useful artifact, such as a working computer program. If the
    program is incomplete and does not do anything, then a small
    improvement will result in a similarly incomplete, broken
    program--so there is little motivation or satisfaction in
    making a small change to it. To finish the program and make it
    useful would require a large amount of work and initially only
    the originator has such a strong commitment.</p>

    <p>A direct consequence of this is that an open-source project
    that starts around a great idea, but with no code written,
    should not expect the community to create a working
    application. The community can only be expected to help develop
    and refine the idea through discussion. If there are one or
    more developers already committed to writing the initial
    version, then this feedback on what the application should do
    can be invaluable--although without a working prototype it can
    also be ungrounded and too blue sky to be practical. The main
    point is that if you start an open-source project without a
    working prototype, do not expect the community to write the
    initial code for you. It just won't happen.</p>

    <p>It may help to think about this in terms of biological
    evolution: Dead matter does not evolve;<sup><a href="#fn15"
    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15" name="fnref15">15</a></sup>
    only living organisms can evolve. They do so as a result of
    random small changes. Some of the changes are improvements,
    whereas others are neutral or harmful to the organism. The
    environment then selects which of these changes are retained
    and which are forgotten, and these selections are passed on
    through reproduction.</p>

    <p>For open source, every new idea posted to the project's
    mailing lists and each contribution of code is a potential
    change. With new ideas, the community acts to select which are
    to be discussed further and possibly become part of the
    project's goals. For code, the module owners are the ones to
    select which changes are accepted and added to the project's
    code base. Note that the module owners cannot dictate what
    other developers work on--in some sense, incoming contributions
    really are random.</p>

    <p>Most changes will be small bug fixes or minor improvements,
    but occasionally someone will contribute ideas or code that is
    a major change, possibly taking the project in a new direction.
    As with biological evolution, these large jumps cannot be
    predicted. They are also experiments that may or may not
    succeed. Just like life, open-source projects must embrace
    these opportunities to remain vibrant.</p>

    <p>Evolutionary processes tend to be profligate in their use of
    resources--they are not what a manager would consider
    efficient. However, through large-scale parallel exploration of
    possibilities, evolution discovers wonderful innovative
    solutions. Open source combines the directed efforts of
    proprietary software development, in the focused work done by
    the core team, with the open-ended contributions made by
    volunteers.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="co-evolution-of-software-and-community">
    <h2>Co-Evolution of Software and Community</h2>

    <p>In an open-source project, software building and community
    building are intertwined. As the software matures, the
    community needs to keep up with it--the principle of slowly
    dawning insights applies to both activities.</p>

    <p>An example is the Apache Incubator Project, which was
    created in October 2002. It provides an entry path into the
    Apache Software Foundation for projects and code bases whose
    owners wish to become part of Apache. The Incubator also
    provides documentation on how the Foundation works and how to
    get things done within its framework.</p>

    <p>The Incubator is a community structure that was developed
    after the code base became large, sophisticated, variegated,
    and widely adopted. This required creating a controlled and
    self-explanatory mechanism for joining the community.</p>

    <p>The Apache Software Foundation has apparently discovered the
    work-in-progress effect and is using it explicitly. At the top
    of the home page for the Incubator it says the following:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Notice: This document is a WIP (Work In
      Progress).<sup><a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id=

    </blockquote>
  </div>

  <div id=
  "variations-on-open-source:-gated-communities-and-internal-open-source">
  <h2>Variations on Open Source: Gated Communities and Internal
  Open Source</h2>

    <p>Sometimes a company is not willing or able to relinquish all
    control of the source code it has written. It may be that sale
    of the software is too important a part of its business. Or it
    is unwilling to give up the intellectual property (IP) used in
    the software--or it cannot because it uses another company's IP
    that it only licenses. Whatever the reason, it chooses not to
    open source its code. There are two important variations on
    open source that the company can consider in order to get at
    least some of the benefits of collaborative development. The
    first is to share only with people or companies that agree to a
    license that lets them see the source code but that strictly
    limits what they can do with it. The other alternative is to
    keep the source code totally within the company, but allow
    access to it by the company's developers who are working on
    other projects. Both options reduce the size and scope of the
    potential community but can still provide additional value.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="gated-communities">
    <h2>Gated communities</h2>

    <p>One of the hallmarks of open source is that anyone can
    redistribute the code, with or without changes, to anyone else.
    This is not so when the source requires a special license that
    restricts the distribution only to other licensees. For
    example, from 1975 until 1992 anyone wanting to access the
    source code for the Unix operating system was required to
    purchase a license from AT&amp;T. Many organizations relied on
    the Unix sources distributed by the University of California at
    Berkeley, but they all were supposed to have an official Unix
    license from AT&amp;T. It was only after 386/BSD was released
    in 1992, followed by releases by both the NetBSD and FreeBSD
    projects in 1993, that source code for a full Unix system
    became freely available as open source.</p>

    <p>A source license can be used to create a gated community:
    Anyone agreeing to it is in the community, and anyone who does
    not is left outside the gate, unable to see and use the source
    code. This can be attractive to the company that wrote the
    source code because it can still sell the software and retain
    all of its IP. Whether this is attractive to outside developers
    depends on the other license terms.</p>

    <p>The most restrictive source licenses only allow a licensee
    to look at the source code--a licensee cannot modify or
    redistribute it. Even this little access can be useful if you
    are building other software that must interoperate with the
    licensed software. The source code essentially provides
    additional documentation and can aid debugging. This is what
    Microsoft offers with its Shared Source program for its Windows
    operating system. Those few companies that qualify can use the
    source code to help them better understand Windows in order to
    debug or tune their own hardware or software. A less
    restrictive source license might allow a company to modify the
    source and use it internally, but not distribute it to
    anyone.</p>

    <p>Only when the license allows redistribution is an
    open-source community possible. For example, Sun's former Free
    Solaris Source License Program allowed anyone who had signed
    the license to view and modify the Solaris 8 source code.
    Licensees were allowed to distribute their changes only to
    other licensees via a Sun secure website that included mailing
    lists for discussing the source code.<sup><a href="#fn17"
    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17" name=
    "fnref17">17</a></sup></p>

    <p>Licenses of this type often make a distinction between
    commercial and research use. Commercial use is when a company
    takes the source code and modifies it to create a product it
    then sells or uses internally for a production system. Such
    commercial use may require an additional license, possibly
    including royalty payments to the original author of the source
    code. Research use involves no sales or other commercial gain,
    and the distribution of binaries to anyone may be allowed.</p>

    <p>The Java community is a good example of a gated community.
    It is an open organization of international Java developers and
    licensees whose charter is to develop and revise Java
    technology specifications, reference implementations, and
    technology compatibility kits. Java technology was originally
    created by Sun Microsystems and released under the Sun
    Community Source License (SCSL). Decisions are made using the
    Java Community Process (JCP), which has evolved from the
    informal process that Sun used beginning in 1995 to a
    formalized process overseen by representatives from many
    organizations across the Java community. The original reason
    for using a gated community was to maintain the compatibility
    of different Java implementations--write once, run anywhere.
    Now that Java is established and seen as a standard, the JCP is
    beginning to allow true open-source Java development.</p>

    <p>The Jini project is another example of a gated community. It
    uses a variant of the SCSL that allows free commercial use and
    has a more democratic governance structure.</p>

    <p>In fall 2000 Hewlett-Packard's printing and imaging division
    launched what it calls the Collaborative Development Program
    (CDP), a secure web-based development environment that links
    HP's worldwide employees, business partners, and customers to
    collaborate on software development projects. As of early 2002,
    the program hosted over 350 projects and 3000 users;
    approximately 10% of the users are external to HP. Forty-five
    external companies are developing projects with HP using
    CDP.</p>

    <p>Some of the benefits of joining a gated community include
    using the source code as additional documentation, enhanced
    ability to find and fix bugs, ability to make local
    modifications, and ability to obtain and share modifications
    with others. The disadvantages can include the tainting of your
    developers by their seeing proprietary code, licenses that do
    not allow modifying the source code, and licenses that do not
    allow you to share changes with others.</p>

    <p>The company that originally created the software can benefit
    from additional sales due to the extra value customers perceive
    from having access to the source code, assistance in finding
    and fixing bugs, customer porting of the code to additional
    platforms, improvements that can be distributed to other
    customers, and receiving better feedback from customers.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="internal-open-source">
    <h2>Internal Open-Source</h2>

    <p>The source code for most proprietary software is usually
    seen only by the team of developers assigned to work on it.
    Some companies limit which employees are even allowed to look
    at a program's source code, and most companies severely control
    who can modify source code. Some companies do have code reviews
    where people not on the team look at the code, but their
    involvement is generally limited to a critique of the code.</p>

    <p>It can be to a company's benefit to open up the source code
    to everyone within the company. Access to a product's source
    code provides documentation to those developing other products
    that must interoperate with it. It can help in testing and
    fixing bugs. It can facilitate code reuse. In short, all of the
    same benefits that outside companies can get by being able to
    see the source code are available with internal open source.
    Even when sharing totally within a company, proposed changes
    must still be approved by the project's core team or other
    people who have earned their trust. We refer to such projects
    as internal open source, but others sometimes use the term
    <em>corporate source</em> .</p>

    <p>Sharing source code within a company is much simpler than
    sharing it with those outside. Internal use requires no
    software licenses, just putting the source on some internally
    accessible file server. Of course, so far we're speaking only
    of the technical aspects of sharing--it may take a very big
    shift in mindset to open up a project's code to developers in
    other parts of the company. In fact, one of the biggest
    benefits might be increased communication between different
    parts of the company.</p>

    <p>The focus on creating communities is a major difference
    between internal open source and other programs many companies
    have to encourage software reuse. Software reuse has at its
    core the idea of a library of reusable software components
    maintained by a code librarian. The code is usually seen as
    being static--contributed by a developer on one project for use
    on unrelated other projects. Software reuse projects often fail
    by not addressing social and political issues inside the
    organization. Internal open source must also overcome similar
    social and political obstacles, but they are faced more
    directly in working to build a community of developers and
    users to collaborate on an application that the community is
    all interested in moving ahead. If your company has a software
    reuse program, to make it more successful consider using
    open-source principles to build communities around the various
    components and frameworks.</p>

    <p>Because internal open source takes place totally inside a
    company, there is no way to know just how many companies are
    applying open-source principles to their internal development
    process. Both VA Software, with their SourceForge product, and
    CollabNet, with SourceCast, are companies committed to open
    source that make their living by selling collaborative software
    development tools to other companies. Although many of their
    customers may only be seeking assistance for geographically
    distributed project teams, others are no doubt taking advantage
    of the ability to involve people outside of a project in its
    development.</p>

    <p>Hewlett-Packard started a Corporate Source Initiative to use
    open-source practices internally in June 2000. One of the major
    goals of this program is to increase the technology transfer
    from HP Labs to the rest of the company. By using the community
    building aspects of open source, HP hopes to build a stronger
    community within HP Labs and then extend that community to
    include other developers in the rest of HP who are working on
    products, infrastructure, and corporate operations. By early
    2002 it had about 1500 registered users working on about 30
    projects, all of which were research projects not tied to any
    HP product. Researchers at HP Labs have written about a
    variable approach to open source they call <em>progressive open
    source</em> (POS) to describe the range of ways a company can
    use open-source development methods: traditional open source,
    gated communities, and internal open source.<sup><a href=
    "#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18" name=
    "fnref18">18</a></sup></p>

    <p>IBM uses tools from VA Software--SourceForge Enterprise
    Edition--to host an internal-project, open-source site called
    the <em>Internal IBM Open-Source Bazaar</em> , where any team
    can do open-source development within IBM. The tool provides a
    source-code repository, mailing lists, source-code control
    mechanisms, and license management. The site supports hundreds
    of projects and thousands of developers working on open-source
    projects that IBM doesn't want exposed to outside parties. IBM
    is one of about 50 companies that use SourceForge Enterprise
    Edition for their internal open-source projects.</p>

    <p>Sun Labs set up a very similar program inside Sun called
    OpenProject, starting in December 2001, with the twin goals of
    helping with technology transfer from Sun Labs to the rest of
    Sun and providing a home for small, unsponsored projects to
    encourage innovation. In May 2002 the scope of OpenProject grew
    with the addition of a number of groups from Sun's Enterprise
    Services organization that wanted to build communities around
    the development and use of internal Sun tools. These tools
    include the various applications that are used internally by
    Sun field engineers and customer support to install, test, and
    maintain Sun computers. The aim is to enable the worldwide
    shared development of these tools, as well as to create forums
    where Sun employees can locate the tools they need and discuss
    how to best use them. By March 2004 there were over 800
    registered users of OpenProject working on over 300 hosted
    projects, most of which were internal tools.</p>

    <p>Internal open-source projects need to be nurtured just as
    all open-source projects do. In fact, they may need even more
    support from managers and executives because the people
    involved in them do so as part of their job and, although the
    project may benefit the company as a whole, their involvement
    can be seen by their immediate manager as taking too much time
    from their assigned job.To manage and guide this internal tool
    development effort, a special Technical Council was created
    with representatives from organizations throughout Sun. This
    Technical Council is responsible for locating existing tools
    and working with their developers to contribute their source
    code to OpenProject, for identifying gaps in the existing tools
    and developing new tools to fill them, for pointing the
    community to what is cool and identifying the best-of-class
    tools, and for encouraging groups and engineers throughout Sun
    to work together.</p>

    <p>Done correctly, internal open source allows a company to
    leverage the work of all of its employees, to eliminate
    duplicate work, and to encourage innovation. The same
    open-source principles come into play whether the potential
    community is the entire Internet or just a single company's
    intranet.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="open-source:-why-do-they-do-it">
    <h2>Open Source: Why Do They Do It?</h2>

    <p>One of the first questions a dyed-in-the-wool businessperson
    will ask about open source is why in the world people would
    volunteer to do something that they could be paid to do.
    Numerous explanations have been put forward, including the
    following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Need for the product--in order to create, customize, or
      improve a product or feature. This reason dominates the
      decision-making process for all early participation in both
      open-source and gated-source projects, but, as time goes on,
      continued participation is based on other things for
      open-source projects whereas a need for the software
      continues to prevail as motivation for gated-source
      projects.</li>

      <li>Enjoyment, fun, and desire to create and improve--because
      they enjoy it and find creating or improving software
      creative and interesting. This is the primary reason people
      continue in open-source projects for the long term. Such
      people tend to scan the email archives, bug reports, and
      feature-request lists to find things that catch their eye,
      things that are challenging or represent an area they want to
      learn about.</li>

      <li>Reputation and status--in order to build or maintain
      reputation or status within the community.</li>

      <li>Affiliation--in order to socialize or spend time with
      like-minded individuals.</li>

      <li>Identity--in order to reinforce or build a desired
      self-image.</li>

      <li>Values and ideology--to promote specific ideals, such as
      the free software philosophy.</li>

      <li>Training, learning, reputation outside the community, and
      career concerns--to improve their skills, with the belief
      that such improvement will lead to a better job or
      promotion.</li>

      <li>Fairness--to pay off the debt they owe from having used
      the software or received help from the community. For some,
      the bargain takes a long time to pay off.</li>

      <li>Hope of making things better--to find or create better
      solutions than those already in place.</li>

      <li>Feedback--to get comments on the work and how well they
      are doing as a programmer or designer. As with other creative
      activities, this is a driving urge. Here is what open-source
      expert Sonali Shah says,</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      <p>... creative programmers want to associate with one
      another: only their peers are able to truly appreciate their
      art. Part of this is that programmers want to earn respect by
      showing others their talents. But it's also important that
      people want to share the beauty of what they have found. This
      sharing is another act that helps build community and
      friendship.<sup><a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id=

  <div id="what-is-open-source-1">
    <h2>What Is Open Source?</h2>

    <p>Open source is about software source code, licenses,
    communities, culture, and distributed software development.
    Although open-source projects can provide plenty of benefits
    for companies who use it, open source is not something to do on
    a whim. Open source is based at least in part on a phenomenon
    called the gift economy, which on the surface seems at odds
    with corporate practices.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, marketing and innovation benefits, as well as
    clearly separating commodity efforts from value-enhancing ones,
