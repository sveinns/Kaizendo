<div id="why-consider-open-source">
  <h1>4. Why Consider Open Source?</h1>

  <p>An open-source project works best when everyone involved
  derives some benefit from it. There must be a good reason for a
  person or group to make its work available and for other
  people--users, developers, and other interested parties--to want
  to participate.</p>

  <p>One very compelling reason for you to participate in an
  existing open-source project is if your work can build on it. By
  joining the project, you avoid needing to redo large amounts of
  work. Plus, there is an existing community of users and
  developers who have an interest in what you are adding to their
  project. An example of this was Sun's contribution of its Java
  Server Pages technology to the Apache web-server project to
  create the Jakarta project.<sup><a href="#fn1" class=
  "footnoteRef" id="fnref1" name="fnref1">1</a></sup> By doing
  this, Sun assured that JSP would become available on the most
  widely used web server, that the Apache developers would not
  create a competitor to JSP, that it would be easier to work with
  other companies such as IBM on JSP technology, and that JSP could
  build on the work already done for Apache. For the Apache
  community, adding JSP was a way to add desired functionality and
  expand the community of Apache developers; it was also a vote of
  confidence in their work with Apache.</p>

  <p>There are many reasons for people to participate in an
  open-source project. These include the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The software being developed helps them to do their work
    better.</li>

    <li>They can influence development.</li>

    <li>They can modify the code to suit their needs.</li>

    <li>They can interact with and learn from other users.</li>

    <li>They can be part of a cool project.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These are also reasons why you might choose to join an
  existing open-source project.</p>

  <div id="business-reasons-for-choosing-to-open-source-your-code">
    <h2>Business Reasons for Choosing to Open Source Your Code</h2>

    <p>Deciding to manage a development project as an open-source
    project requires making a careful determination of the
    project's business goals--an open-source project is generally
    more expensive to operate than a proprietary project, and there
    are different scheduling and development processes that need to
    be adopted and that can affect product delivery.</p>

    <p>The following is a list of business reasons to support the
    use of open source for a project. To illustrate them, we
    provide concrete examples based on our experiences with various
    Sun-sponsored projects such as NetBeans, OpenOffice, Project
    JXTA, Java.net, and Jini.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="visibility">
    <h2>Visibility</h2>

    <p>When a project is run using open source, the existence and
    nature of the project are visible to the outside world and to
    people in other parts of your company. If the project is
    visible to a strategically important community--whether it
    participates in the project or not--your company is better able
    to present plans, goals, features, and statements of progress.
    Open source makes available additional communication channels,
    including more informal ones consulted by the target developer
    community.</p>

    <p>For example, any sort of open, Java-related activity, such
    as the NetBeans project, enables the Sun developers working on
    it to use the various Java newsgroups as well as Slashdot and
    other weblogs to communicate directly with other developers.
    Although this is a good way to get feedback from the community
    about technical matters, it is not suited to marketing
    hype.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="training-and-education">
    <h2>Training and Education</h2>

    <p>The best way to learn design and implementation skills is to
    read and study good designs and source code. This teaching
    method is rarely used in software development and engineering
    curricula, so it's often up to companies to do on-the-job
    training. Whether the open-source project is internal or
    external, it can supply source code, design documents (or at
    least archives of design discussions), and provide
    opportunities to try out ideas and talk to designers and
    implementors.</p>

    <p>In general, this is an advantage with transparency. For
    example, creative writing, music, art, sculpture, and most
    engineering disciplines use publicly visible artifacts to
    educate practitioners. Apprenticeships are a classic form of
    observational education. In some older crafts, an apprentice
    would do menial tasks such as cleanup and setup for months or
    years before actually being instructed and helping with the
    real work, and this was educational because the apprentice
    could observe the craftsperson at work, which would help him or
    her know what practicing the craft was all about.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="ubiquity">
    <h2>Ubiquity</h2>

    <p>By providing an open-source offering, a project can begin to
    spread that offering first to the outside users and developers
    of the project, then out to the broader open-source community,
    and then perhaps to the larger developer community. Both the
    no-cost and open nature of the offering and the transparent
    stance of the project to the users of the offering contribute
    to the spread of the offering. The transparent stance conveys
    the message that your company's developers don't consider
    themselves the ultimate authority on the offering and not only
    value the contributions of the community but consider other
    members of the community as equals.</p>

    <p>For example, an explicit goal of NetBeans was to create a
    common IDE platform that would be one of the three most popular
    Java development environments. This is a ubiquity goal. Jini is
    another example of a project that has attempted to establish a
    new, ubiquitous platform for services. Eclipse is also directed
    at ubiquity.</p>

    <p>Another example is StarOffice, for which ubiquity includes
    creating a large and diverse user base. A person might go to
    OpenOffice.org to download the latest version, but then stay to
    participate in the mailing-list discussions of how to best use
    the OpenOffice application and how it might be improved.
    Because of the feeling of community that arises from being part
    of those discussions, the person is much more likely to
    recommend OpenOffice to others; and a user becomes a community
    member.</p>

    <p>Ubiquity helps a company engage in service businesses. With
    Eclipse, IBM is creating a plug-in platform that its
    professional services business can leverage, and similarly GE's
    involvement with the Visualization Toolkit enables them to have
    more convincing and substantial engagements, both inside and
    outside the company.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="design-discipline">
    <h2>Design Discipline</h2>

    <p>Doing development open-source style requires making almost
    all decisions on mailing lists open to the public. Design and
    implementation proposals are made in writing and discussed by
    the community, and the resulting decisions are summarized in
    writing. All this written material is archived and available to
    everyone. By enforcing this level of discipline, the quality of
    the design and implementation decisions is likely to
    increase--simply because they are being done deliberately and
    in writing. The process of writing it all down creates a need
    to express issues in a clear way, which often forces you to
    better understand matters. This better understanding then leads
    to a better design. In many ways, the open-source process
    resembles the literate programming methods promoted over the
    years by computer scientists such as Donald Knuth.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="best-standards-development">
    <h2>Best Standards Development</h2>

    <p>Some projects have as a goal developing a standard--API
    definitions, language extensions, or tool extensions. Opening
    up the process to everyone makes it more likely to get the best
    advice and achieve the greatest adoption.</p>

    <p>The best and first example of this is the Common
    Lisp<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2" name=
    "fnref2">2</a></sup> community, which was created precisely to
    do standards development. Initially, the goal was a de facto
    standard embodied in a particular book (<em>Common Lisp the
    Language,</em> by Guy L. Steele Jr.) and a set of informal
    agreements, but after the artificial intelligence industry and
    the Department of Defense embraced the language, it became the
    subject of ANSI standardization.</p>

    <p>The NetBeans IDE APIs had been designed in an open way to
    begin with, so an open-source approach simply maintained this
    practice. A goal for OpenOffice was to create an XML standard
    for file formats.</p>

    <p>In general, it appears that a standardization effort that is
    based on an open-source or commons-based community is less
    likely to suffer from the worst of politics. Open-source and
    commons-based communities almost always have at least a hint of
    meritocracy built in, where status and influence are based on
    achievements within the community rather than on the strength
    or influence of the organization that the individual
    represents. Further, the decision-making conversations in such
    a community are much more likely to center around technical and
    engineering issues than around business and marketing
    issues.</p>

    <p>For example, the Jini Community is partially organized
    around a standards-granting body. Because the community is made
    up of both individuals and companies, its organization has two
    &quot;houses,&quot; one in which each individual has one vote
    and the other in which each company has one vote. Any proposed
    standard must be approved by both houses to be adopted by this
    community. The discussions in this community about proposed
    standards indeed revolve around the technology, and the
    community has been quite successful at getting companies to
    work together that traditionally have had a lot of trouble
    doing so. We believe it is important that the sponsoring
    company, Sun Microsystems, rarely has a significant stake
    directly in the application area and thereby can act as an
    unbiased helper in the discussions--Sun's stake is in the
    underlying infrastructure that Jini provides, which is provided
    at no cost.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="conversations">
    <h2>Conversations</h2>

    <p>A technology company can thrive when it engages in
    conversations with its customers and potential customers. Such
    conversations largely take place between a salesperson and a
    technical customer, but relationships between technical staffs
    are important.</p>

    <p>Open source is a way to engage a broad group of people--fans
    and foes alike. Some of the conversations are about design and
    implementation issues directly associated with the source code,
    but there are many other, indirect opportunities for a company
    to learn.</p>

    <p>It is relatively rare for an outsider to be interested in
    helping a company with its proprietary products, and frequently
    outsiders are not in a position to know enough about a
    company's strategy and dynamics to offer useful advice. But, by
    listening carefully to the corners of the conversations with
    outsiders in an open forum such as an open-source project, a
    company can learn quite a bit that could impact new products
    and product directions.</p>

    <p>By listening to people talking about the challenges and
    problems they face--particularly with the technology of the
    open-source project--a company can figure out what new products
    or directions would help with those problems. When participants
    talk about how they use some other technology in conjunction
    with the technology being developed by the open-source project,
    a company might make plans to integrate this other technology
    or make it easier to work with by creating or extending the
    infrastructure. This is not the same as just doing what the
    customer says because the customer might not know or care
    enough about the technology behind the solution--it's seeing
    the problems and trends that matter. The listening company
    needs to think and problem solve carefully to come up with a
    good solution.</p>

    <p>Such conversations sometimes are more natural face to face.
    A sponsoring company can arrange for a community meeting or
    other event where members of the community are given an
    opportunity to talk about their projects and work. The wise
    company will send someone hopelessly curious to find out all
    about the problems and exciting opportunities facing community
    members and thereby arrange to bring back valuable ideas for
    new products.</p>

    <p>Naturally, conversations such as these can forge
    relationships between companies, such relationships being less
    likely in the more adversarial and isolated world of business.
    By letting people talk to people, companies can talk to
    companies.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="design-help">
    <h2>Design Help</h2>

    <p>By opening up the design process to the community, a project
    can get not only advice on direction but help on how to design
    the implementation for that direction. This can come in the
    form of what is generally considered design, as well as
    direction regarding features and usability from pure users. We
    call users who provide good directions and even pure design
    <em>user/designers.</em></p>

    <p>Most developers don't distinguish between development and
    design, so by aiming for development help, many open-source
    projects expect design help as well. Getting design help was an
    important goal for the Jini project, because for Jini success
    meant defining Jini services for printing and consumer
    appliances that fall outside of Sun's areas of expertise.
    Community feedback on the benefits of using NetBeans, not just
    as an IDE but also as an application run-time platform,
    resulted in adding a new direction to the NetBeans project. Now
    NetBeans also supports developers who wish to create
    applications on top of the NetBeans core framework. This new
    focus on NetBeans as a platform has also helped to improve the
    NetBeans IDE.</p>

    <p>Of all the business reasons given here, design help may be
    the most important. Many software products fail because they do
    not meet the needs of their intended users. An article in
    <em>Scientific American</em> by W. Wyatt Gibbs
    (&quot;Software's Chronic Crisis,&quot; September 1994) stated
    that &quot;some three quarters of all large systems are
    <em>operating failures</em> that either do not function as
    intended or are not used at all.&quot; Indeed, the 1994
    <em>CHAOS Report</em> by the Standish Group stated that over
    30% of software projects are canceled, with the greatest risk
    factor being lack of user involvement. User feedback, coupled
    with the open-source practice of incremental development and
    frequent releases, helps keep a project in touch with reality
    and focused on what is most important. Feedback from users
    includes answering the question of whether the project is even
    worth doing at all.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="guidance-for-proprietary-products">
    <h2>Guidance for Proprietary Products</h2>

    <p>Some open-source licenses permit proprietary products to be
    based on an open-source system, sometimes by adding features
    and sometimes by providing quality and support. The ability to
    develop the best such product can be improved by commentary and
    feedback from the community.</p>

    <p>Apple's Darwin open-source project, of course, forms the
    basis for OS X--it is the underlying operating system on top of
    which the nice Finder-based look-and-feel is implemented.</p>

    <p>Guidance for proprietary products was a major goal for
    NetBeans, with the Forte for Java Internet and Enterprise
    Editions being for-sale products built on the NetBeans
    platform. (<em>Note:</em> Forte for Java has been renamed Sun
    Java Studio.)</p>
  </div>

  <div id="build-a-market-for-a-proprietary-product">
    <h2>Build a Market for a Proprietary Product</h2>

    <p>When a company has a proprietary product built on top of a
    free, open-source version, the free version will bring in
    customers and increase the company's market share. Users of the
    free version can be persuaded to upgrade to the for-sale
    version to get new features, better support, training, or
    consulting services. It also makes it more difficult for
    competitors to enter the market because they will need to
    compete with a free product.</p>

    <p>Rather than having their proprietary product possibly
    compete with their open-source version, some companies make
    them one and the same. However, new features may appear first
    in the proprietary version and make their way into a later
    release of the open-source version only after a delay of
    several months. Customers who want the latest features are
    often willing to pay for the proprietary version rather than
    wait for them to be added to the free version. This approach
    was pioneered by Aladdin Enterprises for GhostScript, probably
    the world's most widely used second-source PostScript and PDF
    interpreter, and has also been used by TurboLinux.</p>

    <p>Another approach is to release the software as open
    source--using a license such as the GPL that requires that any
    larger work based on the open-source code also be made open
    source--and then license the software to any companies that
    wish to use it in a proprietary product. This is what Trolltech
    AS does with its Qt multiplatform application development
    framework, which is the basis of the open-source KDE graphical
    desktop for Linux. It is also the strategy used by both MySQL
    AB and Sleepycat Software for their database products.</p>

    <p>Being able to sell or license a proprietary product based on
    an open-source code base requires that a company own the
    copyright to all the source code and be doing most of the
    development of the code. You should expect only minimal
    contributions from outside developers, who are generally not
    eager to have a company profit from their work.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="development-help">
    <h2>Development Help</h2>

    <p>One of the myths of open source is that an open-source
    project will attract a lot of developers, and therefore the
    costs of operating a project using open source will be lower
    than using proprietary processes. This isn't true<sup><a href=
    "#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3" name=
    "fnref3">3</a></sup> primarily because most software is still
    largely monolithic or made of modules that are too large and so
    most volunteer developers do not have the time or motivation to
    fully understand the code well enough to want or be able to add
    significantly to it. However, finding bugs, fixing some bugs,
    and porting software to other platforms or making it work in
    new configurations are the sort of help a project can
    reasonably hope to get.</p>

    <p>If the code for your project is relatively modular and
    doesn't require weeks of study in order to be modified, then
    you can expect outside developers to contribute code for new
    features and even entire new modules. But note that these
    contributions will probably not be for features you had planned
    on for the next release. Instead they will be whatever the
    individual outside developers need for their work. Such
    contributions may appeal to many other community members,
    broadening the project's scope.</p>

    <p>NetBeans is structured as a set of modules communicating
    through APIs. One goal was to create a community of module
    developers, which has happened: Outside developers have indeed
    contributed new modules and continue to work on them.
    Similarly, the OpenOffice community has been effective in
    improving its huge code base by adding new modules for spell
    checking and printing, helping port OpenOffice to Linux,
    working on a port to Mac OS X, and localizing it to more than
    two dozen languages.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="internal-open-source-and-reuse">
    <h2>Internal Open Source and Reuse</h2>

    <p>A company can use an open-source methodology within its
    walls for a variety of internal benefits. By organizing
    development around the commons, the entire organization can be
    informed about which projects exist, how the project is doing,
    and who is working on it. Sometimes people can make quick but
    significant contributions. And sometimes the organization can
    make use of intermediate releases and participate in quality
    control. For companies that do alpha and beta testing, such
    internal releases can help find and fix problems before--rather
    instead of--releasing them outside the company.</p>

    <p>Detailed internal information such as this can benefit
    sales, marketing, and sales engineering by providing ways of
    finding out information without (over)burdening
    development.</p>

    <p>But most important, doing internal open source opens up the
    possibility of reuse. By reuse we don't mean the planned
    <em>use</em> of libraries and frameworks but the unexpected and
    serendipitous reuse similar to what happens when you visit the
    junkyard or scrapheap. There may be pieces of code not designed
    to be used in multiple contexts that can cannibalized or used
    in unexpected ways, and an open-source or commons-based
    development approach can provide visibility into projects,
    thereby encouraging such reuse.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="support-help">
    <h2>Support Help</h2>

    <p>One of the hallmarks of a good open-source project is that
    community members provide support to each other. More
    experienced developers and users help out folks with less
    knowledge, and practically everyone answers the questions
    posted by beginners. Community members assemble and edit lists
    of <em>frequently asked questions</em> (FAQs) and post them to
    the project's website. Some folks may even write tutorials and
    articles to help others get started. All of this community
    support activity is work that you do not need to provide
    resources to do.</p>

    <p>For the Jini project, Sun's top developers participate on
    the public mailing lists. This has attracted lots of
    experienced outside developers to these lists because they know
    both that they can get their advanced questions answered there
    and also that they can benefit from seeing the answers to other
    people's questions. Because of the community feeling that has
    been created, these outside developers are then willing to
    answer the less difficult questions, freeing up the Sun core
    team to do other work.</p>

    <p>But keep in mind this is not a way to get something for
    nothing. There must be a reason for knowledgeable folks to want
    to visit your project's website and participate in discussions.
    One of the best reasons is that you have one or more employees
    participating who are even more experienced and who can answer
    the more difficult questions that are posted to the project's
    mailing lists. This could be some of your senior developers, or
    someone slightly less experienced who can refer the question to
    the appropriate senior developer. It should not be a junior
    person because community members will quickly perceive this and
    feel that you consider them second-class citizens.</p>

    <p>Although Jini is mostly a community of developers, this
    sharing of support also works with users, as can be seen on
    OpenOffice.org. The OpenOffice community has written
    <em>How-to</em> guides giving step-by-step instructions on how
    to do specific tasks with OpenOffice, has put together lists of
    FAQs, and has created sample and template files that
    demonstrate OpenOffice's capabilities and how to accomplish
    certain tasks. This help has been made available in many
    languages including Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German,
    Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. The website also has a
    general users' mailing list--plus native language mailing lists
    in over two dozen languages--where anyone with a problem can
    post questions that others in the community will answer.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="facilitate-technology-transfer">
    <h2>Facilitate Technology Transfer</h2>

    <p>When you are introducing a new technology and trying to
    spread it to other developers, creating an open-source project
    can help. The project provides an attractive place for people
    to come to learn the new technology by doing things with it and
    seeing what others are doing with it. The people that
    originated the technology are available to answer questions and
    to steer further development based on community feedback.</p>

    <p>The Jini project is an example of how a gated-community
    effort can help to introduce many new developers to a
    technology. Having Sun's core Jini team working with outside
    developers that were trying to learn about Jini created a
    vibrant Jini community that continues to flourish and to help
    introduce Jini technology to new developers.</p>

    <p>This is very different from creating a user group for a
    technology. User groups tend to be places for novices to go to
    download tutorials and white papers, to read FAQs, and to ask
    their questions. Aside from the occasional online chat session,
    there is no sense of discussing issues with the team developing
    the technology. As a result, as soon as developers start to
    master the technology they tend to drift away.</p>

    <p>Using corporate source can facilitate technology transfer
    within your company. When ongoing research is both visible and
    accessible through an internal open-source effort, developers
    in other parts of your company can learn about and experiment
    with new technologies and better relate them to your products
    and marketplace. Just encouraging more communication between
    researchers and the rest of your company can be a win. Both HP
    Labs and Sun Labs have internal open-source efforts to help
    them to move new technologies into the rest of the company.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="limited-resources">
    <h2>Limited Resources</h2>

    <p>Sometimes you just may not have enough resources to do all
    the work that's needed on your own. We've pointed out several
    times that you can't expect volunteer help to pick up the
    slack, but there are several other open-source-related options
    that might work for you.</p>

    <p>The simplest is building on top of an existing open-source
    project. If the work you want to do adds value to the work
    already done by the project and fits in with its vision, then
    the community will welcome your contributions. Depending on the
    project's license and philosophy, you might be able to create a
    for-sale product if that is important to your business
    model.</p>

    <p>Sun took this route when deciding how to improve the desktop
    shipped with Solaris. Rather than investing the effort in
    upgrading its proprietary Common Desktop Environment (CDE), it
    made more sense to switch to GNOME and focus Sun's resources on
    improving certain aspects of GNOME such as accessibility,
    integration with Java, and documentation--all areas where the
    GNOME community welcomed additional participation.</p>

    <p>If there is no existing project you can join, then creating
    a new open-source project or a gated community might work,
    provided that you can recruit other companies and individuals
    that share your vision and are willing to work to realize it.
    An open-source project may provide a better framework than
    trying to set up a more formal consortium. The way Java is
    developed is an example of this strategy: Through the Java
    Community Process, new extensions to Java are jointly developed
    by participating companies that write the necessary
    specifications, reference implementations, and technology
    compatibility kits.</p>

    <p>You can also use corporate source to pool the efforts of
    developers and engineers throughout your company that have
    common needs. For example, within Sun various teams in
    different parts of the company each needed to develop an
    internal tool to monitor service requests (trouble tickets) and
    report various statistics about them. A team in France
    developed a client-server version of the tool, which they then
    shared with another team in Germany that had been looking into
    writing a similar one. The German team had to rewrite part of
    the tool to work in their particular environment, but that was
    much easier than starting from scratch. Moreover, their revised
    version improved on the server component and the French team
    was able to adopt their changes. Meanwhile, other teams in the
    United Kingdom and Sweden have joined in the effort and are
    working on other improvements. Each team now has a better tool
    with less effort on its part then if it had developed it
    alone.</p>

    <p>Note that all of these options are quite different from
    putting out a half-done project and hoping someone will come
    along to help finish it.</p>

    <p>When releases are made available to users early in the
    development process, bugs are more likely to be caught. When
    the source code is made available to developers outside the
    core team, those bugs can be located and fixed. The outside
    developers can also add many of the small features that the
    core team wants but doesn't have time to get to--making the
    product more usable. This all results in greatly improved
    quality in the official release. Moreover, the bugs that bother
    users the most are the ones that are actually most apt to be
    fixed.</p>

    <p>For example, sendmail is the Internet mail program used in
    the majority of email systems worldwide. Eric Allman,
    sendmail's original author and now CTO of Sendmail Inc., which
    offers a commercial version based on the open-source version,
    had the following to say on how open source improves product
    quality:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Another thing I've learned big time is that there is no QA
      department better than the Internet itself. Nobody can afford
      to simulate the Internet QA lab. By having the open source
      support, we get this incredible base of people that are
      willing to be on the bleeding edge, and give great
      feedback.<sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"
      name="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Perhaps the Visualization Toolkit people would dispute this
    by claiming that adding automated testing to an open-source
    project achieves an even higher level of quality.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="time-to-market">
    <h2>Time To Market</h2>

    <p>For open source, there is a time-to-market advantage, but it
    is a more complicated notion than simply getting a product into
    a space quickly. By using available open-source code in a
    project, a company is able to avoid re-inventing it. This can
    speed up getting to market, but the more important effect is
    that a company can get to a very good product quickly,
    especially one with a greater number of already proven features
    and better quality. That is, the right product is achieved
    faster. If existing open-source code is available, this could
    also mean getting a product into the new market space ahead of
    the competition. If such code isn't available and the idea is
    to start an open-source project to design and implement a new
    product, then the company will not get a product out faster
    than by going it alone, but the initial open-source-based
    product will probably be a better product than one done with
    proprietary methodologies. Tellis and Golder argue this is
    likely a better strategy than simply being first (see the
    section <sup><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"
    name="fnref5">5</a></sup> which was created primarily as a
    community site but also as a sort of central open-source
    hosting site for Java-related projects--a kind of SourceForge
    for Java. However, not only were the usual open-source tools
    provided, but social software tools such as wikis and weblogs
    were added. The website has a newspaper feel, and there is a
    site editor, akin to a newspaper's editor-in-chief. The goal is
    to bring together open-source developers in the hopes that a
    marketplace might develop.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="avoiding-lock-in">
    <h2>Avoiding Lock-In</h2>

    <p>A common strategy for companies is to offer a high-value
    product and create brand lock-in--making it hard to move to
    another product--by providing special platform-specific
    capabilities. An open-source community will not tolerate
    proprietary lock-in and will generally move toward making the
    offering as portable as possible.</p>

    <p>This was a major goal for NetBeans, where the competitors to
    NetBeans and Forte for Java were seen as promoting lock-in not
    only to their own IDEs but perhaps also to particular Java
    implementations.</p>

    <p>This could be a goal for Eclipse, as well. IBM is concerned
    with the dominance of Microsoft in the software development and
    server markets, and Eclipse certainly could be aimed at
    providing a popular, open-source alternative to Microsoft's
    proprietary products in this area.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="risk-reduction">
    <h2>Risk Reduction</h2>

    <p>Of concern to many companies is the risk they face if a
    software product they depend on is discontinued. With
    open-source applications, they know they can continue product
    development even if the original developers stop working on it.
    In the past, the primary way of reducing the risk that a
    producer would abandon software or go out of business was a
    practice called <em>software escrow</em> wherein the source
    code was held by a third party as if in a vault whose contents
    were to be released to the consumer of the software upon
    certain contractually defined events.</p>

    <p>The risk that a software product might stop being supported
    can be acute when the product is offered by a small company.
    Customers are often wary of buying a product from a small
    company because the company might go out of business. By making
    the product open source, a small company can assure customers
    that even if the company disappears the software will still
    survive. Rather than making its money from software sales, the
    small company would instead need to sell support, training,
    and/or consulting services.</p>

    <p>Making an application open source also reduces the risk for
    the company that initially developed it. For example, Cisco
    Systems decided to release their Cisco Enterprise Print System
    software (CEPS) under an open-source license partly to reduce
    its dependency on in-house programming staff. Cisco wanted to
    make sure that if the original programmers left the company,
    the software would continue to be maintained. In fact, one of
    the two original developers did eventually take a new job
    elsewhere, but, because it is an open-source project, he has
    been able to continue to work on it. If a developer really
    identifies with a project, then you can ensure that person's
    participation for a long time by making it open source.</p>

    <p>Another way that a company reduces its own risk by making a
    product open source is that the outside developers who work on
    the project become attractive candidates to hire: They are
    knowledgeable about the product and have a proven track record.
    There are numerous examples where a major contributor is later
    hired by the company that started the open-source project.</p>
  </div>

  <div id=
  "appeal-to-the-community-whose-name-is-the-open-source-community">
  <h2>Appeal to the Community Whose Name Is &quot;The Open-Source
  Community&quot;</h2>

    <p>Some open-source pundits and leaders talk about &quot;the
    open-source community&quot; as if it were a clearly
    identifiable set of people. Some even speak as if this
    community were homogeneous and universal, making statements
    such as &quot;the open-source community rejects&quot; some
    company-sponsored project. This happened to the Jini project
    when it first appeared.</p>

    <p>Jini was one of the first forays by a large company into
    commons-based software development. (Other small companies,
    such as Lucid, Inc., in the 1980s, worked on open-source
    software as part of their product strategies.) Jini was
    released under a gated-community license called the Sun
    Community Source License (SCSL), and Sun termed this sort of
    license a &quot;community source&quot; license, both to
    distinguish it from open-source licenses and to ensure that
    there would be no confusion between the two types of
    development communities. Some of the open-source leaders
    denounced Sun for hijacking the concept of open source, for
    confusing the public by introducing a new name, and for
    introducing a new model. Further, some of these leaders stated
    to the press that open-source developers were not interested in
    community source and did not participate in the Jini community.
    Actually, there were quite a few open-source developers in the
    Jini community at that time and still are.</p>

    <p>Since then, the early leaders of the &quot;open-source
    community&quot; have grown to accept community source and other
    gated communities to the extent that they don't go out of their
    way to criticize them much. And many of those leaders have come
    to accept that this is a different idea needing a different
    name to avoid confusion. Moreover, these leaders have assumed a
    diminished role as open source has been adopted by more
    companies and people.</p>

    <p>A prime example of this was releasing the StarOffice source
    code under the GNU LGPL. Using that license, which is a
    favorite of many in &quot;the open-source community,&quot;
    improved Sun's reputation.</p>

    <p>But even today there is a benefit to be had by gaining the
    acceptance of and positive statements from the pundits and
    leaders of &quot;the open-source community&quot; and of some of
    the smaller communities within it. For example, the Linux
    community is a thriving Unix community within the broader
    open-source community. By doing an open-source project, the
    organization running the project can get closer to that
    community.</p>

    <p>The open-source community was not a strong Java development
    community when NetBeans was open sourced in June 2000. In fact,
    much of this community is not a strong C++ development
    community, favoring C instead. Further, this community was slow
    to pick up Java partly because of Sun's ownership of it. By
    doing a full-up Java project as open source, Sun hoped to
    improve its standing with that community. Note that since then
    many successful Java open-source projects have been created and
    that there is now a very large and vibrant open-source
    community for Java.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="storytelling-through-connected-activities">
    <h2>Storytelling through Connected Activities</h2>

    <p>This is a general marketing-based goal. Typically marketing
    takes place via collateral material, events such as JavaOne and
    product launches and press releases. There are not very many
    ways to get small pieces of news into the world. Websites have
    helped with this. An open-source project has a website, mailing
    lists, and community events, but they are aimed more at
    developers and users than at the press and analysts. It is
    possible to tell these smaller stories within the context of
    normal open-source communications. For example, a developer
    could mention in a design consideration something that implies
    a new strategic direction for your company. Even simply having
    a developer at your company working hard at making some program
    or system work well on a competitor's system conveys a story
    about your company's values that is not possible to tell
    through normal marketing avenues.</p>

    <p>Storytelling was an explicit NetBeans goal, although it is
    not likely that many outside the inner circle of the
    NetBeans-community designers were comfortable thinking of it in
    this way. The Forte for Java product line is marketed partly
    through the open-source project, and statements about the Forte
    for Java direction are made indirectly through the actions and
    discussions by NetBeans developers working in the NetBeans
    community.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="statement-of-vision-and-terms-of-engagement">
    <h2>Statement of Vision and Terms of Engagement</h2>

    <p>Sometimes a company would like to make a statement of vision
    or establish new terms of engagement. This can be thought of as
    changing or adding to the conceptual landscape of the field or
    market. For example, when IBM wanted to establish itself
    further as a leader in part of the Java landscape, it released
    Eclipse as open source. Eclipse is &quot;a kind of universal
    tool platform--an open extensible IDE for anything and nothing
    in particular.&quot;<sup><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id=
    "fnref6" name="fnref6">6</a></sup></p>

    <p>At that time, the only significant open-source Java IDE was
    NetBeans. IBM had established itself as a supporter of open
    source through its support for Linux, and it had put out some
    small open-source projects such as Jikes, but it had yet to
    make a big statement of its beliefs in open source in the Java
    arena. Moreover, it didn't have an open-source Java IDE as its
    competitor, Sun, did. The full Eclipse story is recounted
    later.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="statement-of-values">
    <h2>Statement of Values</h2>

    <p>Doing an open-source project signals your company's belief
    in open-source principles and acknowledges that the world
    beyond your company is full of expertise and innovation. It is
    a statement of humility. Every open-source project achieves
    this result, at least to some degree.</p>

    <p>The previous example about working to enhance the
    performance of a competitor's product shows that your company
    cares about its customers and wants to provide them with the
    best products possible--even if they come from a
    competitor.</p>

    <p>The business goal that is achieved by affirming your
    company's values is indirect, helping to establish your
    company's reputation. This, in turn, influences how potential
    customers and business partners think about your company and
    what they expect in their dealings with your company.</p>

    <p>An important characteristic of a company is its
    trustworthiness. Trustworthiness is hard to come by--you cannot
    achieve it with a single act but only with a long sequence of
    good acts. Trustworthiness is also built by making what you do
    very transparent so that there are no secrets. Open source is a
    way to live in a glass house; and when people observe you
    acting well just as they often do, then your trustworthiness
    will increase.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="get-brand-loyalty-for-your-companys-hardwaresoftware">
    <h2>Get Brand Loyalty for Your Company's Hardware/Software</h2>

    <p>Creating a community of users and developers around an
    open-source project earns your company the reputation of being
    a &quot;good guy,&quot; and that can create brand loyalty.</p>

    <p>Every company-sponsored open-source project has this goal,
    whether stated or not. For example, with NetBeans the primary
    business goal was to increase the number of Java developers by
    providing a solid Java IDE, but making it an open-source
    project helped Sun gain some brand loyalty for both the Sun and
    Java brands.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="get-the-hit-effect-working">
    <h2>Get the Hit Effect Working</h2>

    <p>By studying how movies and popular music become runaway
    hits, researchers have found that a large network of key
    influencers can cause a word-of-mouth wildfire to spread
    rapidly. If the right people speak favorably about a work,
    those favorable words can spread and the same favorable message
    bumping into the same person from different directions can
    cause that person to become a fan. This can happen with an
    open-source project when key influencers are in the community
    and are favorable to its projects.</p>

    <p>This is an important mechanism for ubiquity.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="create-a-marketplace">
    <h2>Create a Marketplace</h2>

    <p>By providing a ubiquitous open-source platform, you can
    create a marketplace for add-ons, support, and other related
    products and services. Having an open-source base platform
    greatly reduces the risk a player in the new marketplace must
    take on because there is no single owner of the underlying
    technology to possibly leave the market or go out of
    business.</p>

    <p>Building a marketplace can require a multistep process using
    at least two distinct approaches. The first is to build an
    open-source community around a single software project that can
    have associated, perhaps for-sale software developed by outside
    parties. NetBeans is an example. NetBeans is an IDE that
    enables modules conforming to certain APIs to be plugged into
    it, and these modules are the goods in the marketplace. Sun
    hopes that it can participate in the marketplace with
    proprietary software, and that the existence of the marketplace
    for Java increases the Java programmer population. Eclipse,
    originally an IBM open-source project and associated IDE, is
    another example of this approach. Part of this marketplace can
    be seen at the Eclipse plug-in website,<sup><a href="#fn7"
    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7" name="fnref7">7</a></sup> which
    describes itself as a portal and marketplace.</p>

    <p>The other approach is to build an infrastructure for a set
    of open-source projects centered on the technology around which
    the company wishes to form a market. Sun has built such an
    infrastructure and community called Java.net. Java.net is both
    a set of communities that creates Java software and a website
    containing infrastructure to host those communities. Groups and
    companies are encouraged to host their own open-source projects
    at Java.net at no cost, and, because there is also an active,
    portal-like community associated with Java.net, ideas and
    partnerships may spawn as well as source code spreading.
    Java.net is therefore like a great city attracting creative
    people into its neighborhoods. A second, loosely affiliated
    website called Java.com is provided where Java software can be
    advertised and sold. In each of these examples (NetBeans,
    Eclipse, and Java.net), an open-source approach was used to
    anchor a community that creates the desired marketplace.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="commoditize-competition">
    <h2>Commoditize Competition</h2>

    <p>Providing a no-cost offering can force a competitor to play
    a commodity game where small advantages and brand loyalty, for
    example, can play a stronger role than in a high-value
    game.</p>

    <p>OpenOffice is an example of this goal: Its free
    office-productivity software makes it more difficult for other
    companies, such as Microsoft, to charge large amounts for
    proprietary software with similar features. It transforms
    office-productivity software from a high-value, single-vendor
    product into a commodity.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="pricing-for-small-businesses">
    <h2>Pricing for Small Businesses</h2>

    <p>Small companies face problems that larger, more established
    companies do not. We have already mentioned how making a
    product open source reduces customer risk because the product
    can then survive a small company going out of business. Making
    a product open source can also resolve a potential problem of
    how to price the product.</p>

    <p>When a small company enters an existing market and
    underprices its product to be competitive, customers will
    wonder why the price is low. This suspicion may keep customers
    away from the new product. If the company meets market prices,
    then it comes up against many other issues that favor large,
    established companies. Making the product open source makes the
    question of pricing go away. Customers no longer wonder why the
    price is so low because this aspect of open source is
    understood. They are okay with the product being
    &quot;free&quot; and the small company charging for a nicely
    packaged version of the software, manuals, support, and
    training or consulting services.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="acquisition-and-partnership--personal-and-corporate">
    <h2>Acquisition and partnership--personal and corporate</h2>

    <p>In the mid-1990s DOOM was released as open source. DOOM is a
    first-person shooter (FPS) game. Since then, there has been
    growth in the development and distribution of <em>mods</em> ,
    which are variants or updates to proprietary computer game
    engines that have game-extension capabilities such as scripting
    languages. The current range of mods includes new game types,
    game character models and skins (surface textures), levels
    (game play arenas or virtual worlds), and artificially
    intelligent game bots (in-game opponents). Two game companies,
    id Software and Epic Games, provide tools for creating mods and
    require essentially open-source licenses for their creation.
    Half-Life: Counter Strike is among the most popular of the FPS
    games (fall 2003) and was developed under an open-source
    license. The two primary developers now have a financial
    arrangement with Valve, the commercial developers of Half-Life,
    sharing in the revenue stream for Counter Strike.</p>

    <p>This is a business model in which developers create a market
    with an open-source project based around a commercial product.
    By increasing the size of the commercial product's market,
    these developers might be able to arrange a partnership with
    the commercial company or be bought out by it.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="the-eclipse-story">
    <h2>The Eclipse Story</h2>

    <p>Eclipse is a good example of a successful business-related
    open-source project. As with all real success stories, there is
    no single or simple thread or fact that explains all aspects.
    That is, Eclipse was done as open source not for one strategic
    reason but instead for several.</p>

    <p>Since the time IBM committed to Java, the company had
    developed a strong competence and practice in Java. Because IBM
    values being able to work with customers on their own terms, it
    wanted to bolster Java in the marketplace so that it would not
    need to invest excessively in maintaining multiple expertises.
    Because Microsoft succeeds at least partly by providing good
    tools for developers, IBM wanted to establish serious
    competition for Microsoft Visual Studio in the eyes of
    developers. Further, IBM had had only modest success selling to
    customers who were not already IBM's. Open source provided
    legitimacy to appeal to the Linux, C, and Microsoft installed
    bases without involving much IBM baggage. Eclipse was a way to
    address these issues.</p>

    <p>There was also the issue of effort. For a plug-in technology
    such as Eclipse, the problems of integrating a variety of
    pluggable components were bigger than one company could
    continue to solve while providing sensible investments in the
    infrastructure, and open source could provide a way to share
    the costs while providing a broad set of tools.</p>

    <p>To accomplish these goals, IBM decided to engage the
    open-source community.</p>

    <p>Where did Eclipse come from? The Eclipse project was the
    natural follow-up to IBM's VisualAge family of development
    tools. Many of the substantial contributions to Eclipse came
    from a Canadian company IBM had acquired called Object
    Technology International (OTI), headquartered in Ottawa. OTI
    had previously developed IDEs and virtual machines
    (VMs)<sup><a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8" name=
    "fnref8">8</a></sup> for IBM's VisualAge Smalltalk and
    VisualAge Java. The early work on a Java-based IDE was part of
    a broader research effort on multiple language technologies at
    OTI where the IDE was given the internal name Eclipse.</p>

    <p>The goal of the OTI Eclipse project was to provide IBM
    product developers and key independent software vendors (ISVs)
    with a common, extensible tool platform competitive with
    Microsoft's Visual Studio. The first commercial release of
    Eclipse technology was IBM's VisualAge Micro Edition (later
    called WebSphere Studio Device Developer), an IDE for embedded
    Java development where important design constraints come from
    diminished computing and presentation resources.</p>

    <p>The Eclipse team had two primary objectives for the roll-out
    of the technology:</p>

    <p>Deliver technology to establish a perception of
    ubiquity--that developers, engineers, and users all use (this
    is a bottom-up developer-to-developer approach).</p>

    <p>Build an ecosystem or marketplace for companies to build
    commercial offerings on top of the open-source base; the hope
    was that this would generate a healthy tension between the
    paradigm of open source and the commercial need for profitable
    products.</p>

    <p>For many computer companies, a medium- and long-term
    strategy is to work with researchers and educators who then
    train their students on that company's products and technology.
    This translates into future sales and loyalty. This is one of
    the reasons that Unix and now Linux are as popular as they
    are--Unix was once a staple of university computer science and
    engineering departments. However, this requires investment and
    an understanding of the university and laboratory scene, which
    were problems for IBM. Eclipse provided technology that
    researchers could get excited about.</p>

    <p>Similarly, IBM had difficulties penetrating non-IBM
    installed markets despite the existence of both programs and
    investments in this area. In both these cases, IBM was unable
    to make headway in markets and communities important to its
    future. Eclipse provided the perception of independence and
    provided a forum for competitors and other IBM outsiders to
    observe and with which to engage.</p>

    <p>Eclipse could have been released as a free but proprietary
    tool, but IBM realized that the platform would see wider
    acceptance in the broader developer and vendor community if it
    were made a true open-source project. Furthermore, this would
    drive home the message that Java and open source could provide
    a serious challenge to Microsoft. By providing the ability to
    support platforms and languages other than Java, Eclipse
    enabled developers with existing languages and tools to benefit
    from the same IDE framework and tools, providing many of the
    benefits of Visual Studio Net. This reduced the need for
    expensive tooling for a wide variety of researchers and tool
    vendors.</p>

    <p>IBM therefore made a concerted effort to engage educators,
    researchers, vendors, and key influencers to move Eclipse from
    an IBM internal development to a full open-source project. The
    internal code name was familiar to developers, so IBM deviated
    from its normal naming practices and allowed the internal code
    name Eclipse.org to represent the project. This provided a
    lightning rod for developers expressing their frustration at
    Sun's control of Java.</p>

    <p>IBM brought some well-known names into the mix: Erich Gamma
    was the first author of <em>Design Patterns</em> , and Kent
    Beck was a founder of the software patterns community and the
    father of Extreme Programming. Gamma is now one of the main
    Eclipse project leaders, and he and Beck wrote a book called
    <em>Contributing to Eclipse: Principles, Patterns, and
    Plugins</em> , which is part of a new Addison-Wesley series
    called The Eclipse Series.</p>

    <p>IBM played its marketing hand quite well. IBM sponsored
    Eclipse receptions and workshops at major object-oriented
    programming conferences, produced the excellent book mentioned
    above, made research grants to universities, and eventually
    created an Eclipse conference, called EclipseCon. The
    Gamma-Beck book was given as a gift to all attendees of OOPSLA
    2003 by IBM Research.</p>

    <p>This extraordinary marketing effort combined with the
    technical excellence of Eclipse resulted in the Eclipse
    project's having 50 corporate members and 18 million downloads
    by the end of 2003. Further, this success also motivated IBM to
    spin out Eclipse.org in 2004 as a nonprofit foundation; this
    new Eclipse.org has a tiered hierarchy of governance and
    management, with IBM retaining a small but significant degree
    of control in the form of having a member on the board of
    directors and a full-time executive director to lead the
    management team. Three separate councils oversee Eclipse
    development projects.</p>

    <p>As part of the spin-out effort, IBM reached out to other
    companies such as Sun, which was suspicious about IBM and had a
    major investment in its own IDE, NetBeans. Sun declined to join
    Eclipse.org.</p>

    <p>The result was that IBM gained the high ground and changed
    the landscape for competition in Java tools platforms. Eclipse
    is the exemplar in this area, and the vocabulary and terms of
    engagement in this arena are largely under IBM's control.</p>

    <p>Two facts about Eclipse raise the question of whether part
    of IBM's strategy was to deliver some tweaks to Sun as part of
    their cooperative/competitive relationship. First, even though
    the choice of the name Eclipse might not have been aimed
    originally at Sun, the fact that it has the meaning of
    overshadowing the Sun was probably not a negative factor in
    IBM's decision to use the code name as the external name.
    Second, IBM had always felt that Sun had been overbearing in
    its control and expansion of Java, and therefore IBM might have
    been trying to wrest some control from Sun and criticize it
    technically by using a different windowing toolkit from the
    standard one, which is called Swing. The toolkit Eclipse uses,
    called the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT), was considered by
    some to be easier to work with than Swing and performed better
    on the operating systems platforms to which it was
    targeted.</p>

    <p>The question of the toolkit, however, is complicated, as
    such things always are. A hallmark of the VisualAge family was
    portable support for native look and feel; this was carried
    forward with SWT, which leveraged OTI's peer-layer experience
    with Smalltalk IDEs. Because SWT already existed for WebSphere
    Studio Device Developer, time-to-market considerations added to
    the push to use SWT in Eclipse as a graphical user interface
    (GUI) for Eclipse-based tools.</p>

    <p>The Eclipse story is only one of IBM's engagements with open
    source, which includes working on Linux--again to create an
    alternative to the Microsoft platforms. Although IBM's
    commitment to Eclipse is significant, it spends much more on
    Linux.</p>

    <h2>Creating Your Business Model and Following Through with
    It</h2>

    <p>Every company is interested in activities that support its
    business. You must be able to explain how the relevant business
    goals for your project contribute to your company. Some of the
    goals we have listed, such as selling a proprietary product
    based on an open-source project, have a direct connection to
    revenue. Others have a more indirect connection, such as better
    relations with customers, making it easier to sell your
    company's hardware or services into an organization.</p>

    <p>For example, Sun makes most of its money by selling
    hardware, so any software that encourages customers to buy Sun
    servers or workstations supports Sun's main business model. It
    can do so directly by providing desired functionality and high
    quality, as Solaris does. It can do so by offering an
    alternative to software available on other platforms, such as
    StarOffice. It can try to level the playing field (or even tilt
    it in Sun's favor) by establishing new standards, as Java does.
    It can try to create a new market where Sun can be a major
    player, such as Jini. It can do so by gaining developer
    mindshare, so more applications for Sun hardware will become
    available, such as NetBeans. If shifting to open-source
    development will make these activities more likely to succeed,
    then a strong case can be made to do so. As an aside, please
    note that each of these strategies may be best supported by a
    different type of license; we discuss licenses in the next
    chapter.</p>

    <p>Many outside developers are suspicious of the motives of
    large companies and will view an open-source project sponsored
    by such a company as an attempt to pull a fast one. To quell
    these fears, you must be able to explain how your company plans
    to benefit from participating in the open-source project. Only
    when they understand what your company plans to gain will they
    be comfortable supporting the project. If they don't hear a
    sensible business reason for why your company is using open
    source, you can be sure that someone will suggest a variety of
    sneaky motives, often based on the fears open-source developers
    have that companies will steal their work and put it into
    proprietary products. If you are not willing to disclose your
    main business reasons, then you should rethink making your
    project open source.</p>

    <p>Your business model justifies your use of open source both
    to managers within your company and also to outside developers.
    It is important that you be able to communicate your business
    model to both groups.</p>

    <p>You will also need to explain your business model to other
    groups within your company that you need to interact with.
    Other parts of your company will expect your project to be
    business-as-usual and may not be happy when they find out
    otherwise. For example, if another group inside your company
    has a product that depends on yours, then you need to explain
    to them that the company does not control the release schedule
    and that your project will not do a release if your community
    feels the code isn't quite ready. You can expect there to be
    lots of pressure on your project to act like a normal
    proprietary project.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="measuring-success">
    <h2>Measuring Success</h2>

    <p>There are fairly standard ways of measuring whether a
    proprietary project is successful. These include product sales,
    market share, number of bugs, meeting schedule deadlines, and
    other familiar assessments. Many of these also apply to
    open-source projects, but there are additional metrics that are
    necessary.</p>

    <p>Each of the business goals for your project should have an
    associated measure. Here are some possible metrics for various
    business goals.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ubiquity: number of users, number of mentions by the
      press, response by competitors</li>

      <li>Standards development: number of participating parties,
      number of parties adopting the standard</li>

      <li>Design help: number of additional user/designers, amount
      of email on mailing lists</li>

      <li>Development help: number of outside developers, number of
      bugs reported/fixed, number/quality of contributions, amount
      of email on mailing lists</li>

      <li>Appeal to community: quality and number of comments in
      open-source community</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By default your project will be measured the same way a
    proprietary one is, which will probably result in the
    open-source activities getting shortchanged. For a successful
    open-source project you need to get management to agree to a
    different set of metrics. The performance reviews for any
    employee participating in an open-source project need to
    include measures for their open-source-related activities. Note
    that just adding new metrics in with all the standard existing
    ones won't work; you cannot expect people to successfully do
    both their old jobs and take on the new tasks required to
    create a healthy open-source community.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="an-example:-the-innovation-happens-elsewhere-strategy">
    <h2>An Example: The Innovation Happens Elsewhere Strategy</h2>

    <p>The business reasons for open source as presented tend to
    have a more tactical focus. Let's now look at an example of how
    open source might support a larger business strategy.</p>

    <p>Most companies are not large enough to influence the
    direction of their own markets, and few companies are able to
    design products that truly serve their customers. Most
    companies find they need to fine-tune designs and products over
    a series of releases. Some companies use time to introduce
    products: The Saturn car company started by introducing
    inexpensive but high-value cars that appealed to young adults
    just starting out in their careers, and, while learning the
    tastes and values of that generation, Saturn has introduced new
    models that reflect the increasing affluence of its core
    customer base. This is an example of using the world outside
    the corporation as a source of innovation. Software companies
    using open source can perhaps exploit this strategy in its most
    pure form. So, what is the strategy?</p>

    <p>To simplify the discussion, let's consider only companies
    that produce technology products. The Innovation Happens
    Elsewhere (IHE) strategy begins by recognizing where the
    company's proprietary value lies. Everything outside this inner
    circle of protected ideas and technology is available for
    instigating outside innovation beneficial to the company. The
    primary goal of the strategy is to increase the number of
    potential customers--that is, the size of the market available
    to the company. To do this, the IHE company tries to create
    more products in the market that either are enablers for the
    products the IHE company sells or form an aftermarket for them.
    Rather than trying to accomplish this alone, the IHE company
    tries to encourage other companies or organizations to do this
    work--but for their own purposes.</p>

    <p>The impetus for companies to do this comes from tools,
    technology, communities, and prototypes that the IHE company
    provides. By opening up part of itself to the outside, the IHE
    company can provide gifts that trigger the gift-economy effect:
    technology; tools, and prototypes that are of high value to
    outside companies and organizations and that trigger them to
    work in areas important to the IHE company; and communities
    where others can work within a culture that supports the vision
    of the IHE company (see Figure 4.1). Let's break this down a
    little.</p>

    <div class="figure">
      <img src="fig4-1.gif" alt=
      "FIGURE 4.1. The Innovation Happens Elsewhere strategy">

      <p class="caption">FIGURE 4.1. The Innovation Happens
      Elsewhere strategy</p>
    </div>

    <p>Giving gifts of technology and tools initially spurs outside
    individuals to work on or with those gifts for their own
    benefit--perhaps one of the tools is useful to a software
    developer for one of his or her home projects. Later, that
    developer might bring the tool into his or her company, where
    colleagues start to use it for their own purposes. Because the
    tool was a gift (and perhaps its source is available),
    individuals and their companies send bug fixes, extensions,
    modules, and ideas back to the IHE company. The gift has been
    picked up--for selfish purposes--but it stimulates a gift in
    turn of work that is of value to the IHE company directly,
    which takes those tools, technologies, prototypes, and ideas
    back and uses them to enhance its own products. In the
    open-source realm, this is the fundamental expected payback for
    opening up software source. For the IHE company, this is only
    the beginning.</p>

    <p>Next, an outside company using gifts from the IHE company
    recognizes that these tools, technologies, and prototypes can
    be combined with its own technology to produce products at
    lower cost, at less risk, and of great value to their customer
    base. Again, this is done for selfish reasons, but such outside
    companies are, by doing this, contributing to expanding the
    customer base for the IHE company. Sometimes a company or
    organization will think of an application or variation of the
    gift that will open it up to entirely new and unexpected
    markets. This is the sort of return gift the IHE strategy can
    provide.</p>

    <p>Even further, the IHE company, by creating, building, and
    maintaining a set of communities around these gifts, can engage
    in serious conversations with outside companies, organizations,
    and individuals. Such conversations not only can improve the
    IHE company's products, designs, and directions, but also
    provides the IHE company with an opportunity to demonstrate
    leadership and vision, thereby putting it in a position to
    strongly influence the direction and structure of the
    competitive landscape. Because this is done in a context of
    gift-giving, culture exchange, and conversations, this is
    leadership and seduction, not control and power. If the IHE
    company exhibits learning in response to these communities,
    other members will continue to give gifts, work with the
    company, and help it maneuver through difficult competitive and
    market situations.</p>

    <p>Communities are also a way to tell stories to the community
    while minimizing the effects of cynical write-off. When a
    company puts out white papers, advertising, and other public
    relations materials, the audience is likely to discount as hype
    statements made there. But within a community, where developers
    and engineers are talking to each other, the messages can be
    both smaller--too small for press releases--and larger: global
    visions and proposals for new directions couched in design and
    other engineering statements. By valuing the comments and ideas
    from outside community members--by showing respect--the IHE
    company can create a channel unlike any other.</p>

    <p>The ability to communicate through communities such as this
    means that the IHE company can nudge the market in directions
    that play to its strengths. And by both demonstrating great
    innovation and respecting the innovation of others and by
    providing just the right gifts, the company can increase the
    size of its market and tune itself and its informal
    &quot;partners&quot; to that market, which is itself tuned
    through the vision of the company. That is, the market, the IHE
    company, and companies in the virtuous cycle of innovation
    co-evolve under the partial direction or influence of the IHE
    company.</p>

    <p>The IHE company takes direct advantage of the returned gifts
    from others, both by using them in its own products and by
    using them to help its internal operations. The IHE company
    puts itself in the best position when it embraces at all levels
    the philosophy of Innovation Happens Elsewhere with people in
    the company always looking inside and outside the company for
    innovation they and their groups can use.</p>

    <p>There are several keys to using this strategy. The first key
    is understanding and isolating the true proprietary value and
    technologies of the company. The more accurately this is done,
    the better able the company is to use its gifts and thrive. If
    what's proprietary and valuable to customers is too small, the
    company will have a hard time surviving as others crowd into
    its space. If what's judged proprietary and of value is too
    large--or too much of what the company makes or works on--then
    there will be few gifts available to get the cycle of
    innovation going.</p>

    <p>The second key is the confidence that your organization can
    engineer products well and quickly enough to stay ahead of
    competition. Microsoft, for example, does not believe it has
    enough of an engineering edge over competitors to do other than
    hold all its source code proprietary. Perhaps this is why it
    tries to combat open source rather than embracing it.</p>

    <p>The third key is a company culture that can embrace and
    celebrate innovations wherever they occur. In a sense, this is
    confidence and enthusiasm for ideas, but it is also respect and
    the right balance of pride and humility. Some organizations
    seem to fear ideas that originate from outside. Such
    organizations cannot use Innovation Happens Elsewhere.</p>

      <p class="caption">FIGURE 4.2. Sun's NetBeans IHE
      strategy</p>
    </div>

    <p>The effect is to increase the population of Java language
    programmers both by providing tools for those developers
    directly and through other companies building on the NetBeans
    platform. This way, not only is Sun Microsystems building the
    Java community, but so are other companies and individuals in
    the NetBeans community. Sun sells an IDE derived from NetBeans,
    but, most important, Sun sells server hardware that runs Java
    particularly well. Further, Java developers within Sun use
    NetBeans and Forte for their own work.</p>

    <p>An unexpected innovation happened when a group removed the
    Java-specific modules from the NetBeans IDE and replaced them
    with mapping, visualization, and analysis modules in order to
    build a modular environment for spatial analysis and
    visualization. This potentially opens up a future geographic
    information systems (GIS) market to Sun, a market not
    originally contemplated.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="lessons-from-the-ihe-strategy">
    <h2>Lessons from the IHE Strategy</h2>

    <p>There are many advantages to using open source, but being
    able to engage the Innovation Happens Elsewhere strategy is
    especially compelling. Not only does it build the market size,
    but the tactics to make it work help companies that use it get
    to better products faster by directly involving the customer
    base in their design. Through direct conversations with
    customers, there is reduced guesswork in gathering market
    requirements. Moreover, there are some operational efficiencies
    to be gained through better testing, community-based support,
    and some significant product contributions.</p>

    <p>Sometimes--no, usually--a surprise will happen; an
    innovation or application of the ideas and technology will come
    along that you have never dreamed of, never heard of, or
    couldn't imagine, done by a group or individual you have never
    heard of. And it could be a pivotal market for your company or
    could change how you view and develop your original
    technology.</p>

    <p>What is most stunning, however, is the difference in the
    feel of companies that truly engage with their communities of
    customers, partners, and competitors. Morale is boosted,
    progress is constant, and it simply feels like something good
    is always happening.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="business-reasons-for-using-open-source-products">
    <h2>Business Reasons for Using Open-Source Products</h2>

    <p>So far we've talked only about reasons to make one of your
    proprietary products into an open-source project. There is also
    the question of when it makes sense for a company to use an
    existing open-source product. We conclude this chapter by
    discussing some of the issues that arise from using open-source
    products in a company setting.</p>

    <p>Basically the same concerns arise with open-source software
    as with proprietary products:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Will it do what you need?</li>

      <li>What type of support is available?</li>

      <li>What is the total cost of ownership?</li>

      <li>Will the software product continue to be developed?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When purchasing a proprietary product you know how to answer
    these questions, but these answers don't apply for open
    source.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="meeting-your-needs">
    <h2>Meeting Your Needs</h2>

    <p>The first question is pretty much the same for any software
    under consideration--how do the features of the software match
    up with your needs? Open-source software is often less polished
    than commercial products, so you need to decide if extra polish
    is worth paying more for.</p>

    <p>Choosing software also involves looking at what other needs
    you have that might be met in future releases. Here the
    transparency of the open-source process makes it easier to get
    a handle on what new features are planned and when they might
    be ready--all of the planning happens on public mailing lists
    and is displayed in the project's roadmap--you can even send an
    email to the main developers. Most companies are much more
    guarded about planned release dates of proprietary products and
    what features will be in future releases.</p>

    <p>If a feature you need is missing, open source has an
    advantage in that you can work with the project to add it. You
    can lobby with the community about adding the feature, have
    your own developers write the needed code, or hire consultants
    to do so.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="getting-support">
    <h2>Getting Support</h2>

    <p>When you buy a product from a company, you expect that the
    company will stand behind its product by providing both a
    warranty and product support. If you have a problem, you
    believe that you can go to the company and legally it is
    required to fix that problem. Although this may be true for
    physical products such as automobiles, by far the majority of
    commercial software products come with very limited warranties
    and minimal support. If you've ever read the End-User License
    Agreement (EULA) for a piece of commercial software, then you
    know that the warranty is basically just a refund of your
    purchase price. And if you've ever tried to get basic, no-cost
    support from a large software company, then you know how
    difficult and frustrating it can be--although some do have lots
    of good information available through the company's website
    that more sophisticated users can take advantage of. Most
    companies do have support plans that you can purchase. Support
    may also be available from third-party companies.</p>

    <p>With open source, there is often no company to deal with.
    However, there is usually a community and that community exists
    in large part to support its members in the use of the
    software. This support takes two forms: online documents and
    discussion forums. When evaluating an open-source application
    you need to check both. Go to the project's website and see how
    much documentation is available, whether a good FAQ for it
    exists, and whether there are active mailing lists or
    newsgroups devoted to user questions. Check if the main
    developers participate in the user forums--tough questions that
    might stump a customer support person for a commercial product
    are often answered by the actual developers of an open-source
    project. Although getting support through a public mailing list
    may seem very informal, many who have tried it find it gets the
    job done, often more quickly and better than previous
    experiences with support for commercial products.</p>

    <p>For the more successful open-source applications, there are
    companies that sell support. For example, rather than
    downloading a free copy of the Linux operating system, many
    people choose to buy it from Red Hat because support is
    included. Other companies, such as Caldera, Linuxcare, and IBM,
    also offer support for Linux, as do many consultants. Some
    open-source projects have commercial versions that are
    supported--StarOffice is a supported commercial product sold by
    Sun that is based on OpenOffice.</p>

    <p>Training is related to support, and, indeed, for popular
    widespread open-source products it is easy to find training
    classes and books, both introductory texts and advanced
    reference material. Some publishers, such as O'Reilly,
    specialize in providing high-quality books on how to use
    open-source applications.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="total-cost">
    <h2>Total Cost</h2>

    <p>Open-source software is not always free--sometimes you may
    have to pay for it, as you do for the basic Red Hat Linux
    distribution--but what you are paying for usually is the
    convenience and quality assurance that went into packaging the
    software. Of course, once you have the software you can install
    it on as many computers as you wish (although the other
    installations might not be covered by the support agreement).
    So, instead of needing to purchase multiple licenses, one for
    each computer you wish to run the software on, open source
    immediately saves you money, possibly quite a lot of money.
    However, keep in mind that your total cost also includes the
    cost of deployment, training, and support, plus indirect
    operating costs due to ease of use (or, more appropriately, how
    difficult it is for your employees to do their jobs using it)
    and interoperability with other software you use. According to
    some studies, software and hardware costs account for less than
    20% of the total cost.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="risk">
    <h2>Risk</h2>

    <p>Considering the expense involved in switching from one
    software application to another, you want to evaluate the
    future prospects of any software you choose: Will it continue
    to be a supported product, or will it be discontinued? If the
    company making it goes out of business, what happens?</p>

    <p>For open source it is important to assess the health of the
    project in order to be confident that the software will
    continue to be developed. To do so, look at the size of the
    community, check how much documentation is available, see
    whether a good FAQ for it exists, and browse through the
    various mailing lists and newsgroups associated with it to
    determine how active the community is. Also check to see how
    often there has been a new release of the software. Look at the
    project's road map to understand the overall vision.</p>

    <p>Even a small project with just a few developers may have
    advantages over a proprietary product. A single developer may
    be more willing to fix bugs and add features. Also, there is
    always the possibility of hiring the main developer as a
    consultant to make the changes you need. Finally, with an
    open-source project of any size your risk is always reduced
    because the source code is available to you.</p>

    <p>As with any company, an open-source project can disappear,
    and with it perhaps its source code and community. You may be
    able to retain rights to use, maintain, and further develop the
    source code if the license gives you those rights. By judging
    the health and importance of the project, you can decide
    whether this is a risk you wish to accept.</p>

    <p>There is another way that open source lets you choose the
    level of risk you are comfortable with. You can minimize your
    risk by using only the major releases that have undergone
    thorough testing. Or you can accept more risk if you want
    access to new features as soon as they have been added to a
    development build. Or you can choose to be somewhere in the
    middle by using the stable builds that are known to at least
    basically work and may have received some testing. Better yet,
    do your own testing if you have the resources.</p>

    <p>One last risk deserves mention if you wish to distribute an
    open-source application, possibly along with some of your own
    products, for use by your customers. By definition, open source
    can be redistributed, but you need to check the license that
    the software uses to determine if there are additional
    conditions that you must meet. If you have not made any changes
    to the software, but are merely redistributing binaries that
    you got directly from the project, then there should be no
    problems, although the license may require that you acknowledge
    the open-source project in your advertising materials or
    restrict your use of the project's name in product
    endorsements. If you have made changes to the software, then
    you may need to make the source code for those changes publicly
    available, depending on the license. Because open-source
    software does not include any warranty or support, your
    customers may expect you to provide both. Finally, some
    companies have tried to scare others away from using open
    source by falsely claiming that, if you merely bundle one of
    your proprietary programs on a CD with an open-source program,
    you then need to make your proprietary source code public--it's
    just not true: Your code stays yours.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="why-consider-open-source-1">
    <h2>Why Consider Open Source?</h2>

    <p>Open source is a commons-based means of doing continuous
    design, but the business reasons for joining or starting an
    open-source project go far beyond source code and distributed
    development. The reasons range over almost the entire spectrum
    of business-related activities: marketing, strategy,
    distribution, sales, human resources, and innovation. The last
    one--innovation--is the one that interests us most because
    without innovation there is no company, and not much fun
    either.</p>

      <p>Although the Lisp language is currently not in vogue, in
      the 1980s it was an important language during the Artificial
      Intelligence boom. Sun, IBM, DEC, HP, and other manufacturers
      of general-purpose computers offered Lisp implementations and
      development environments either developed in-house or by one
      of several third-party Lisp software companies. In addition,
      five companies--LMI, Symbolics, Three Rivers, Xerox, and
      Texas Instruments--produced special-purpose &quot;Lisp
      machines&quot; specifically for executing Lisp code. <a href=

      <p>A virtual machine is software that runs on a real computer
      and presents an execution environment more amenable to
      executing code in a particular programming language than the
      real computer. It is a way to achieve portability of
      applications over a wide range of computer hardware. <a href=
