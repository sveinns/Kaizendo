    <h1>7. Going with Open Source</h1>

    <p>How and Why open source works was described in the previous
    chapters. In many cases, the idea of using open source
    originates with a project leader or mid-level manager in a
    company. This chapter and the two that follow address such
    leaders and managers more so than executives. Our aim is to
    help you decide whether open source is right for your project
    and describe steps you should take to proceed and missteps to
    avoid, if you so decide.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef"
    id="fnref1" name="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>

    <div id="deciding-to-do-open-source">
      <h2>Deciding to Do Open Source</h2>

      <p>After reading the first six chapters of this book, you are
      in a position to make an intelligent decision about whether
      open source is appropriate for your project. Here are some of
      the questions that you need to answer:</p>
    </div>

    <div id="do-you-buy-the-lifestyle">
      <h2>Do You Buy the Lifestyle?</h2>

      <p>Are you willing to do your work in the open and
      collaborate with people outside your company? Will you use
      public mailing lists instead of internal ones? Are you
      willing to spend significant amounts of time discussing
      design and direction with outside community members? Is
      everyone working on your project willing to work this way?
      Are your managers (and their managers) willing to change how
      your project is run? Are you willing to give up total control
      and let the community make many of the decisions?</p>
    </div>

    <div id="does-your-business-model-support-it">
      <h2>Does your Business Model Support it?</h2>

      <p>What are your business goals? Are you trying to make a
      platform ubiquitous, gain developer mindshare, create a
      for-sale product, sell support or services, or something
      else? How does open source help you achieve these goals? How
      will your business model develop over time? Do you need to
      provide support for your product? If so, how will you support
      it?</p>
    </div>

    <div id="can-you-legally-open-source-your-code">
      <h2>Can you Legally Open source Your Code?</h2>

      <p>Does your company own the rights to all of your source
      code? Does it include any third-party code? Does it use any
      third-party intellectual property (such as patents or trade
      secrets)?</p>

      <p>Who is your target audience? Why will these people care
      about your project? What do they get out of it? What licenses
      are they currently using for related projects? Will your
      license be compatible with theirs? Will you be competing with
      an existing open-source project? Is there a working version
      of your code that people can use right now?</p>
    </div>

    <div id="is-your-source-code-open-source-friendly">
      <h2>Is Your Source Code Open-Source-Friendly?</h2>

      <p>Large monolithic and poorly documented applications
      require lots of study before a developer can make even a
      small change. How easy is it for new people to learn their
      way around your code base? Is your code modular? Is there
      sufficient documentation? Are you willing to refactor the
      code? Are the main developers of the code willing to answer
      questions?</p>
    </div>

    <div id="can-you-get-the-resources">
      <h2>Can You Get the Resources?</h2>

      <p>Doing open source requires some basic infrastructure. Can
      you provide the people to maintain the CVS archive, project
      mailing lists and archives, website, and bug database? Can
      you support a community coordinator, a website editor, and a
      buildmaster? Do you have a budget to design and host your
      project's website?</p>
    </div>

    <div id="do-you-have-realistic-and-measurable-goals">
      <h2>Do You Have Realistic and Measurable Goals?</h2>

      <p>How will you know whether your project is a success? How
      can you convince your managers and others at your company
      that you are achieving your goals? For an open-source
      project, success is more than just when you release and what
      features were implemented. Success includes the health of the
      community. What numbers are meaningful for your project goals
      (for example, market share, number of active outside
      developers, number of user contributions, or amount of email
      sent to mailing lists)?</p>
    </div>

    <div id="what-support-do-you-need-from-your-manager">
      <h2>What Support Do You Need from Your Manager?</h2>

      <p>Is your management willing to allocate sufficient
      resources? Will they assess you on the success of the
      open-source effort? If the open-source community needs more
      time to make a decision or get a release out, is your
      management willing to slip schedules, or must you meet your
      company's internal schedules and deadlines at all costs? How
      about other managers at your company who run projects that
      depend on your project?</p>
    </div>

    <div id="how-to-prepare-to-do-open-source-at-your-company">
      <h2>How to Prepare to Do Open Source at Your Company</h2>

      <p>If your answers to the previous questions support the use
      of open source for your project, then what? We now discuss
      some steps you can take to create a successful open-source
      project.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="resources-at-your-company-to-help-you">
      <h2>Resources at Your Company to Help You</h2>

      <p>If your company is already participating in open source,
      then there are probably people in the company able to help
      you get started with your new open-source project--it might
      even be part of their job descriptions. Even if your project
      will be your company's first venture into the realm of open
      source, there are still apt to be internal company resources
      you can draw on to help make your project successful.</p>

      <p>Possibly your company has established some sort of
      Open-Source Program Office to help launch and maintain
      company-sponsored open-source projects. This may include one
      or more people whose job is to monitor and advise groups in
      the company in their dealings with the open-source community.
      They can be very helpful in advising you on what license to
      use, negotiating with outside providers to host your
      project's website, training your team, and building the
      community, for example. They may have an internal company
      website on company procedures for open-source-related
      activities. There might also be an internal mailing list to
      discuss open-source issues.</p>

      <p>Your company's legal department may have some people who
      know about open source, at least from a licensing
      perspective. We say more about legal issues later when we
      discuss getting source code ready to be made public and
      company policies for approving open-source projects.</p>

      <p>You should definitely talk with the folks in any other
      projects within your company that use or develop open source.
      They are the ones who are in the best position to help you
      understand what you are getting yourself into.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="educate-yourself-and-your-team-about-open-source">
      <h2>Educate Yourself and Your Team about Open Source</h2>

      <p>The best way to prepare to do open source is to
      participate in an existing open-source project. You or
      someone from your team should find an open-source project of
      interest and join it. Download the project's code and play
      with it. Follow the mailing lists. Perhaps fix a bug or
      contribute a small modification. Other members of your team
      should also participate in open-source projects that interest
      them.</p>

      <p>Doing this for a few weeks will give you and your
      teammates a good idea of what an open-source project really
      feels like. You will also gain an appreciation for what it's
      like to be an outsider. Were you treated courteously in your
      interactions with the project's module owners and core
      developers? Were your suggestions and contributions dealt
      with promptly? Did you feel accepted and encouraged? This
      should give you plenty to think about when you are running
      your own open-source project.</p>

      <p>Another way to learn about the open-source culture
      firsthand is to join discussions on websites such as
      Slashdot.<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"
      name="fnref2">2</a></sup> Read the postings to see the range
      of people who make up the open-source community--from
      clueless newbies to experienced professionals. Post your own
      comments on topics you personally care about. Please avoid
      flaming. If you post with an email address from your company,
      you might check whether your comments are treated specially.
      Don't feel that you always need to defend your
      company--that's best done by people who don't work for your
      company.</p>

      <p>Not all developers are suited for the open way that
      open-source projects must be run. Getting a taste from
      participating in someone else's project may aid in
      identifying whether you, or someone on your team, is not
      well-suited for open source.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="educate-your-manager-about-open-source">
      <h2>Educate Your Manager about Open Source</h2>

      <p>Developing open-source software is quite different from
      creating proprietary software. You will need the support of
      your manager to succeed. Your manager, and probably his or
      her manager, will also need to understand how open source
      works along with its advantages and disadvantages.</p>

      <p>You need to make sure that your manager does not believe
      any of the various myths and misconceptions about open source
      (see <sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"
      name="fnref3">3</a></sup> provide many of the services your
      open-source project will need. They also charge a significant
      fee per year to do so.<sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef"
      id="fnref4" name="fnref4">4</a></sup> In addition to
      providing the computers and software to host your website,
      the services also include a person to check that the
      community is functioning properly and perhaps another person
      to be the website editor. If your project has any special
      needs, you can contract for additional features. For a large
      project, having CollabNet host the website may make sense.
      Sun uses CollabNet to host a number of its sponsored
      open-source projects such as NetBeans and OpenOffice. Note
      that it can easily take 3-4 weeks to finalize a contract for
      your project, so don't leave creating your website until the
      last minute.</p>

      <p>For its Collaborative Development Program (CDP),
      Hewlett-Packard's printing and imaging division contracted
      with CollabNet to provide web hosting. CDP is a gated
      community where HP's worldwide employees can collaborate on
      software development projects along with HP's business
      partners and customers.</p>

      <p>Sun has a special website called
      SunSource.net<sup><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id=
      "fnref5" name="fnref5">5</a></sup> for smaller Sun-sponsored
      open-source projects. This website is also hosted by
      CollabNet. Because the web infrastructure is shared by a
      number of projects, the cost is much less than setting up and
      running many separate project websites. However, because the
      infrastructure is shared it is harder to add special features
      for a specific project.</p>

      <p>One benefit of using a company such as CollabNet is that
      its staff includes people with lots of experience with
      numerous open-source projects. They can help train your team
      in how to do open source and how to interact with the
      open-source community. Another benefit is that they know what
      tools an open-source project needs and they provide them as
      part of their basic offering. Be aware, however, that they
      may not be able to provide support for additional features or
      to customize your project's pages. Be sure to check out
      several open-source projects that they host to determine
      whether they provide the features that you want for your
      project.</p>

      <div id="use-a-free-open-source-project-hosting-site">
        <h3>Use a Free Open-Source-Project Hosting Site</h3>

        <p>Because many open-source projects are composed largely
        of developers working in their free time with no sponsoring
        organization, websites have sprung up, such as VA Software
        Corporation's SourceForge<sup><a href="#fn6" class=
        "footnoteRef" id="fnref6" name="fnref6">6</a></sup> or the
        Free Software Foundation's Savannah,<sup><a href="#fn7"
        class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7" name="fnref7">7</a></sup>
        that provide free hosting of open-source projects. This is
        great for developers and projects with no budgets, but it
        means you are limited to whatever basic features the
        hosting organization provides, which may include banner ads
        on your web pages. For a small project with limited
        resources, SourceForge or Savannah may be the only possible
        alternative.</p>

        <p>For a small project that may not be very visible, having
        it live on a website that lots of open-source developers
        regularly visit can only improve your chances of potential
        volunteers stumbling across your project. Be sure to
        include a complete description of your project when you
        register it so that anyone searching through the current
        projects can find yours.</p>

        <p>In summer 2004, there were over 83,000 projects hosted
        on SourceForge and over 2000 on Savannah.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="do-it-yourself">
        <h3>Do It Yourself</h3>

        <p>Many of the large well-known open-source projects, such
        as Apache and Mozilla, are self-hosted. Project volunteers
        maintain and support all the infrastructure for the
        website, CVS tree, bug database, and mailing lists.</p>

        <p>Versions of all the tools needed to host an open-source
        project are themselves available as open source. So if you
        choose to, you can do it yourself and set up your own
        website. You will need either to have use of a
        company-owned web server outside your corporate firewall or
        to contract with a company that does web hosting. You then
        do all the work to set up web pages, mailing lists, CVS
        trees, and your bug database. The website for Jini.org was
        at one point run on a workstation owned by the Jini group
        and collocated at Best.com. The IBM subsidiary that
        originally developed the code that became the Eclipse
        project originally hosted the Eclipse website alongside the
        subsidiary's public website.</p>

        <p>It is also possible to buy versions of the software used
        by the open-source-project hosting websites mentioned: VA
        Software sells SourceForge and CollabNet sells its
        successor to SourceCast--called CollabNet Enterprise
        Edition--to companies to set up for their external
        open-source projects or for internal open-source or gated
        communities. An open-source version of SourceForge called
        Gforge<sup><a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"
        name="fnref8">8</a></sup> is also available.</p>

        <p>If you host your project's website on one of your
        company's web servers, then there are several potential
        problems you need to watch out for. First, and most
        important: make sure your open-source project is distinct
        from the corporate website. In order to create a real
        community, you need to give your project's web pages a look
        and feel that is different from those of your company's web
        pages. Ideally, your project will have its own domain name
        and not use a URL that includes your company's domain name.
        Check that your company's policy is flexible enough to let
        your project have its own flavor.</p>

        <p>Next, you need to check your company's policy on the
        types of materials that can be posted on a
        company-sponsored website. The needs of an open-source
        project are quite different from those of a corporate
        website. Posting third-party content is often avoided on a
        corporate website, but it is the lifeblood of a successful
        open-source project. Make sure that keeping an archive of
        messages sent by community members, which might include
        comments critical of your company or one of your
        competitors, is all right. Check that contributions from
        the community can be made available as downloadable files.
        How involved will your company's legal people be in
        approving what goes on your website (such as, liability
        issues, use of trademarks, and compliance with export
        regulations)? Will you be more restricted by being hosted
        on one of your company's web servers than if you had
        contracted with an external web-hosting company?</p>

        <p>Third, find out whether you can directly edit your
        website or whether someone in your company's IT department
        must do this. Having your IT department maintain your web
        server is a major plus, but if the result is that minor
        changes take weeks to enact that won't work very well.</p>

        <p>Some projects combine the do-it-yourself approach with
        the use of one of the free open-source-hosting websites.
        For example, JBoss, an open-source Java application server
        project, has its own website<sup><a href="#fn9" class=
        "footnoteRef" id="fnref9" name="fnref9">9</a></sup> with
        project information and discussion forums, but relies on
        SourceForge<sup><a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id=
        "fnref10" name="fnref10">10</a></sup> to provide its CVS
        tree, bug database, file downloading, and task
        management.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div id="making-use-of-an-existing-website">
      <h2>Making Use of an Existing Website</h2>

      <p>If you are joining an existing open-source project, then
      you will probably be able to use the project's website and
      not have to create a new site of your own. If you are joining
      in on the work of ongoing modules, then all of the mailing
      lists, CVS archives, and bug databases should already exist;
      you just need to subscribe to the mailing lists and start
      contributing.</p>

      <p>If you are developing new modules, then you will probably
      need a new mailing list for each module. If it is a large
      project, then it very likely that there is an easy (possibly
      automated) way to create a new subproject, complete with
      archived mailing lists and a directory in the CVS tree. Some
      open-source efforts, such as Apache, require that you either
      be a member of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) or have a
      member's sponsorship in order to start a new subproject.</p>

      <p>Adding a new subproject to an existing website generally
      will not put a strain on the site's resources. If you expect
      your project will be a significant burden due to the size of
      the code base or the traffic on the discussion lists, then
      you might want to consider donating server machines or making
      a monetary contribution. Talk to the website maintainers and
      find out what they need to make the website better. It's
      always good to volunteer resources, but don't assume they
      will be accepted (for example, a Linux-based website will
      probably not be interested in a Solaris-based web server).
      Having your company listed as a supporter of the website is
      also a plus.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="your-website-needs-an-editor-in-chief">
      <h2>Your Website Needs an Editor-in-Chief</h2>

      <p>Your project may be making great progress as developers
      work on the source code, but, if no one is reporting the
      improvements on your website and general mailing lists, then
      to the outside world your project will look dead. A stale
      website will turn people away, so you need to have someone
      assigned to keep the website home page up-to-date with the
      latest project news. You want your website to attract both
      users and potential developers. The larger your project, the
      more important it is to have a person whose job it is to let
      everyone know what's happening. Editing the website may be
      part of the community coordinator's job.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="cross-linking-with-your-companys-web-pages">
      <h2>Cross-Linking with Your Company's Web Pages</h2>

      <p>You should have pointers to your project's web pages from
      appropriate places on your company's main website. For
      example, on IBM's website,<sup><a href="#fn11" class=
      "footnoteRef" id="fnref11" name="fnref11">11</a></sup> the
      IBM WebSphere Studio Workbench product web pages have
      pointers to the Eclipse website,<sup><a href="#fn12" class=
      "footnoteRef" id="fnref12" name="fnref12">12</a></sup> and on
      Sun's website<sup><a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id=
      "fnref13" name="fnref13">13</a></sup> the Sun Java Studio
      product web pages have links to the NetBeans
      website.<sup><a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"
      name="fnref14">14</a></sup> The editor of your website should
      coordinate with the people managing your company's website so
      that it has up-to-date news of your project. Often, when your
      project is first announced there will be lots of stories and
      links on several of your company's web pages, but months
      later nothing will have changed. Stale references make it
      seem as if your project has not progressed.</p>

      <p>You also should make sure that any link from your
      open-source website back to a commercial website is
      appropriate. Having a banner ad for Sun on the NetBeans
      website would be in very bad taste, as would giving Sun
      preferential treatment with links to Sun products. However,
      having a page of links to companies offering commercial
      NetBeans plug-in modules, including ones from Sun, would be
      okay.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="getting-approval-from-your-company">
      <h2>Getting Approval from Your Company</h2>

      <p>Before you can announce your open-source project to the
      world, you have one last hurdle to clear: getting official
      approval from your company. Working with open source is
      similar to introducing a new product or making use of another
      company's proprietary code. In both cases, your company is
      making a legal agreement that can limit future choices and
      create future obligations. This is all part of normal
      business and so your company should have an established
      procedure for approving the use of open source in company
      activities. Just as most companies require approval before a
      new product is introduced or an old product is retired, there
      should be an official approval process to create a new
      open-source project or end participation in an existing
      one.</p>

      <p>A small company might do this casually, whereas a larger
      company will probably have a formal approval process. If
      you've done all of the steps mentioned so far in this
      chapter, then you should have answers to the questions that
      will be asked during the approval process, and you should
      have no trouble getting your project approved.</p>

      <p>Most companies will have different approval procedures
      depending on whether a project is intended to create a new
      open-source project to release source code developed
      internally (outbound open source) or whether code from an
      existing open-source project will be used in-house or
      incorporated into one of the company's products (inbound open
      source). There may be still a third process to approve
      joining an existing open-source project, where you plan to
      both contribute company-developed source code and make use of
      externally developed code.</p>

      <p>Your company should also have an approval process for
      employees who are working on an open-source project as
      individuals on their own time. Although this is primarily to
      protect that individual and the open-source project they are
      participating in, it can also benefit your company by
      signalling its support for open source.</p>

      <p>Finally, there needs to be an approval process for
      stopping work on an open-source project or decreasing the
      company resources allocated to it. Just as every company
      needs to control how it ends the life of a product, similar
      end-of-life (EOL) considerations apply to stopping work on an
      open-source project.</p>

      <p>Different issues and concerns are important for each of
      these situations; we discuss each in turn. Note that each
      company will have its own process, so you need to contact
      your company's legal department for details of your company's
      policy.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="who-should-be-approving-open-source-activities">
      <h2>Who Should Be Approving Open-Source Activities?</h2>

      <p>Because of the possibly serious implications and
      requirements associated with both inbound and outbound open
      source, it is important that any approval body consist of
      executives at the same level as those who approve new
      products. The approval board should include senior executives
      from development, marketing, product planning, and legal. The
      reviewing team may include the head of your business
      unit.</p>

      <p>It is vital that the approval of a company-sponsored
      open-source project come from a level higher than that of the
      manager who will be running the project, and it should come
      from a level above all of the groups that will be affected by
      the project.</p>

      <p>If you are creating a new approval process for your
      company, be sure to announce it to everyone who might be
      involved. Especially when it comes to downloading source code
      from the Internet, many engineers may not realize that they
      are potentially exposing the company to harm.</p>

      <p>Creating a new open-source project is almost like
      releasing a new product--it consumes company resources, its
      quality reflects on your company, and it implies a certain
      commitment. If you start a new project and it fails, this
      will probably generate bad publicity for and bad will toward
      your company. The approval process needs to weed out the
      badly conceived projects and make sure that proposed projects
      have not neglected anything important.</p>

      <p>There are two parts to a basic approval process for
      creating a new open-source project: a business analysis to
      explain your business strategy and make the case for doing
      open source and due diligence to guarantee that the source
      code does not include any embarrassing comments or
      third-party encumbrances. Only after both steps have been
      successfully completed can the project be started. In fact,
      no announcement of your company's intent to release the code
      should be made until both steps have been completed.</p>

      <div id="requirements-for-the-business-analysis">
        <h3>Requirements for the Business Analysis</h3>

        <p>The business analysis should require you to examine two
        main areas: the suitability of the source code for public
        distribution and the strategic significance for your
        company of releasing the code.</p>

        <p>Steps for determining suitability include the
        following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Identifying the source code.</li>

          <li>Determining what stage of development the code is
          in--is it mature code?</li>

          <li>Confirming that the source code is free of
          viruses.</li>

          <li>Confirming that there is adequate documentation.</li>

          <li>Confirming that the source code is sufficiently
          modular and buildable that outside developers will be
          able to use it.</li>

          <li>Identifying the engineers who will participate on the
          due-diligence team.</li>

          <li>Identifying the employees who will interact with the
          community created by the new open-source project and
          confirming that they all understand how to interact.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Steps for determining strategic significance include the
        following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Listing the business goals for making the source code
          public.</li>

          <li>Identifying the audience/community that will use the
          code.</li>

          <li>Identifying the factors critical to the success of
          the effort, including the resources needed.</li>

          <li>Specifying which licensing model your project will
          use.</li>

          <li>Identifying what the financial impact on your company
          will be.</li>

          <li>Specifying a schedule for the project, including the
          target date to announce the release of the source
          code.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This information should be reviewed by your approval
        board, and if they decide that there are suitable business
        reasons for using open source, then you need to start the
        due diligence process.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="requirements-for-due-diligence">
        <h3>Requirements for Due Diligence</h3>

        <p>Due diligence includes a review of the source code and
        documentation by your company's legal and technical staff
        to determine whether any third-party technology or
        proprietary information has been incorporated into the
        source code you are planning to release. This is done by
        examining the source code thoroughly to determine the
        origin of each part. Any code not developed by your company
        must be checked to determine whether it is under a license
        that allows you to include it in a public release, and, if
        not, the code must be replaced or relicensed.</p>

        <p>The due diligence effort also includes the
        following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Confirming that appropriate copyright, trademark, and
          patent filings have been made.</li>

          <li>Determining whether there are any export
          restrictions.</li>

          <li>Removing any inappropriate, derogatory, or offensive
          statements or references in the source code.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Upon successful completion of the due diligence process,
        the approval board that reviewed the business analysis
        should either approve the project itself or pass a
        recommendation to an appropriate senior executive for final
        approval. Once the project has been approved, you may
        announce the project and release the source code.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div id=
    "getting-approval-to-use-source-code-developed-outside-your-company">
    <h2>Getting Approval To Use Source Code Developed Outside Your
    Company</h2>

      <p>If you are planning on downloading source code that has
      been released under an open-source license, then before you
      can incorporate that code into a company product or use it
      internally you will first need to get company approval. This
      is to ensure that your business unit, any affected functional
      groups (for example, support), and your upper management are
      making informed decisions when they acknowledge and accept
      the risks and obligations dictated by the license that the
      downloaded code uses.</p>

      <p>These risks include the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>No warranties, which means that if the source code
        infringes the intellectual property rights of a third
        party, your company could be required to stop shipping
        products containing the downloaded code and could be forced
        to pay monetary damages.</li>

        <li>No support, so, if needed, your company must resolve
        performance, customer support and maintenance,
        internationalization, and localization issues. (Of course,
        providing support for an open-source product can be an
        excellent business opportunity.)</li>

        <li>Limits on what your company can do with a product based
        on the open-source code, which means that your company may
        not be able to release a larger work under a desired
        license.</li>

        <li>Additional requirements on your company, such as that
        all source code in any derived work must be made publicly
        available.</li>

        <li>Indiscriminate dissemination of the downloaded source
        code within your company, which could permit it to be
        unknowingly used in some other, inappropriate company
        product.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The approval process needs to review the business case for
      using the downloaded code, including how these risks will be
      minimized or handled. Issues that must be addressed fall into
      three main categories: business analysis, strategic analysis,
      and legal review.</p>

      <div id="business-analysis">
        <h3>Business Analysis</h3>

        <p>First you must do the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Identify and describe the technology you wish to
          use.</li>

          <li>Explain the strategic significance of the technology:
          What gap does it fill? What is its benefit to your
          company? What alternatives are there?</li>

          <li>Identify which of your company's products will use
          the technology and how they will use it: Will it be
          embedded in the product or just bundled with it? If
          embedded, will the downloaded code be used as is or will
          it be modified?</li>

          <li>Describe how your company will distribute the
          technology (for example, in source or binary): Will the
          technology's functionality be segregated from your
          company's proprietary code?</li>

          <li>State whether there will be any license fees or
          royalties for the company products that will include the
          technology.</li>

          <li>Explain how the technology will be maintained and
          supported.</li>

          <li>Describe the proposed licensing model for any of your
          company products developed using the downloaded source
          code.</li>

          <li>Estimate the difficulty and the time required to
          remove or replace the downloaded technology if that
          should become necessary.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="strategic-analysis">
        <h3>Strategic Analysis</h3>

        <p>Next, someone from your company's corporate strategy and
        planning department must do the following:</p>

        <p>Ensure that your company's strategic rationale and
        business purposes for downloading the technology are
        consistent with your company's long-term technical and
        business objectives.</p>

        <p>Check with your company's support division that the
        appropriate support and engineering resources are available
        to support the downloaded source code once it has been
        embedded in one of your company's products.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="legal-review">
        <h3>Legal Review</h3>

        <p>And, finally, your legal department needs to do the
        following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Identify licensing requirements, such as needing to
          publish the modified source code.</li>

          <li>Identify any legal risks associated with using the
          downloaded technology.</li>

          <li>Identify any steps or measures to minimize the risks
          or to comply with the licensing requirements.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Once you have the information required by these steps,
        the approval board can review matters. Only after approval
        is granted can the downloaded source code be incorporated
        into a company product. Once it has, your group will be
        responsible for making sure that your company complies with
        any requirements imposed by the download license.</p>

        <p>Several groups in a company might want to use a specific
        downloaded technology--especially one used only internally
        and not in any company products, such as Emacs, Apache, or
        Tomcat. For these cases, it might make sense to create a
        fast-track approval process that can be used to quickly
        approve requests to use downloaded software that has
        already been fully reviewed. The only thing that needs to
        be checked is that the software will be used the same
        way.</p>

        <p>It may also be possible to automatically approve
        software downloaded for an employee's individual use, such
        as a calendar manager, address book, news reader, or web
        browser. The key point here is that the employee is not
        modifying or redistributing the software. But even in these
        cases it is important to check that the license used by the
        software does not preclude its commercial use, the use of
        the software as part of an individual's job.</p>

    <div id=
    "getting-approval-to-participate-in-an-existing-open-source-project">
    <h2>Getting Approval To Participate In An Existing Open-source
    Project</h2>

      <p>If you are planning on having your company's employees
      participate in an existing open-source project, then before
      they can do any work with it you need to get the proper
      approval. This approval process will probably be similar to
      that for participating in a joint effort with another company
      or an industry consortium. In some cases, all that may be
      required is that the direct managers give their approval to
      the participating engineers. For example, a small, focused
      effort by one of your engineers to help an open-source
      project adapt its code to run well with one of your company's
      products should not require a heavyweight approval
      process.</p>

      <p>If code previously developed by your company will be
      contributed to the project or if the code developed by the
      project will be incorporated into one of your company's
      products, then one, or both, of the previous policies may
      apply and require an additional approval process.</p>

      <p>The steps that should be followed before any of your
      company engineers may participate involve the details of the
      open-source project such as the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Describe the overall open-source project.</li>

        <li>Determine the primary reasons that your company should
        participate.</li>

        <li>Determine the precise goals and objectives for your
        company personnel working on the project.</li>

        <li>Determine which open-source license the project
        uses.</li>

        <li>Determine how IP is handled. Does the project allow
        contributors to retain copyright on contributed code?</li>

        <li>Identify other companies participating in the
        project.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There are also steps involving risks to your company's
      intellectual property rights, as follows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Identify the procedures you will put in place to
        prevent any of the open-source code developed by your
        company personnel from subsequently getting mixed with your
        company's proprietary code.</li>

        <li>Determine the likelihood that your company personnel
        developing open-source code will later be asked to develop
        similar functionality in your company's proprietary
        code.</li>

        <li>Determine whether any existing company patents fall
        within the scope of the project.</li>

        <li>Outline the steps you will take while working on the
        project to identify possible future patents.</li>

        <li>Determine whether participation in the project will
        increase the risk that company personnel could disclose
        trade secrets.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Once this information has been obtained and your
      management grants approval, then you can start to participate
      in the open-source effort.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="getting-approval-as-an-individual">
      <h2>Getting Approval as an Individual</h2>

      <p>Many software engineers choose to spend part of their
      personal time contributing to open-source projects. By doing
      so, they learn new technologies, get feedback on their coding
      abilities, and otherwise grow and develop. This is a benefit
      to the company they work for because it makes them more
      valuable as employees. However, it can create a problem if
      their open-source work conflicts in some way with the
      company's business.</p>

      <p>A company may have legitimate concerns about work
      employees do in their spare time. If the open-source work is
      similar to an employee's job then there is the danger that
      the employee will disclose proprietary information concerning
      technical ideas or business plans. This could make it
      impossible to file patents on work the company has done.
      Likewise, the employee might inappropriately take ideas or
      code from the open-source project and use it in a company
      product, thereby tainting it.</p>

      <p>Even when an employee's open-source work and normal work
      assignment are in different areas, the company might have a
      product that competes with that of the open-source project.
      That can create a conflict of interest for the employee.</p>

      <p>Many companies require their employees to sign an
      agreement when they are hired that specifies that the company
      owns anything that the employees invent. Students who are
      receiving support from their university may be in a similar
      situation. If the employees or students contribute to an
      open-source project, then their employer may claim ownership
      of their work. There have been several stories reported at
      places such as Slashdot in which this has indeed happened and
      people had to stop their participation in the open-source
      project and have their code removed from it. This is bad for
      the project, is very bad for the individual, and gives the
      company a bad name. No one benefits from a situation like
      this.</p>

      <p>All these potential problems can be avoided by having a
      simple process for employees to get approval to participate
      in an open-source project. The process should ensure that the
      employees understand company policy regarding intellectual
      property and conflicts of interest. General guidelines should
      be established and communicated to the employees. These
      typically include that any open-source work should be done on
      the employees' own time, should not be done while at work or
      using company equipment, and should not be similar to what
      their normal job duties are. A form amending the original
      employee agreement should be signed by an appropriate-level
      company executive and the employees should receive a copy.
      The form should state that the company gives up any claim to
      the work done by the employees as part of the open-source
      project and that the employees have the right to assign their
      copyrights to the open-source project.</p>

      <p>The need for approval arises largely because of the
      agreement many companies have new employees sign. One
      suggestion from Slashdot is that when starting a new job the
      new employee should rewrite any offending clauses to restrict
      the scope of that agreement. The following is an excerpt from
      that posting:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>A lot of people think they have no negotiating ability.
        You do. When you're thinking of signing on with some
        company, and they send you a boiler-plate contract to sign,
        don't just sign it and send it back. Read it carefully.
        Alter it as you see fit, striking out sections, adding
        sections, and initialing each change. Then sign it, make a
        copy for yourself, and send it back.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Where it says:</p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>company owns the rights to all work produced during the
        term of employment</p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Just strike it out, and change it to:</p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>company owns the rights to code written during working
        hours and in direct furtherance of any tasks assigned by
        the company</p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>See how much nicer that reads? Now, when you do this,
        there are two possibilities: either the company will ignore
        it and hire you, or they will object to your alteration of
        the contract.<sup><a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id=

      <p>Many Slashdot posters have described how they did this
      when they started a new job and that their employers had no
      problem with making any reasonable changes.</p>

    "getting-approval-to-stop-or-lessen-participation-in-a-sponsored-open-source-project">
    <h2>Getting Approval To Stop Or Lessen Participation In A
    Sponsored Open-source Project</h2>

      <p>There will come a time when you need to reduce the number
      of people and resources devoted to an open-source project
      that your company has been sponsoring. Because it is an
      open-source project, this is a much more public announcement
      than reducing the number of employees working on some
      internal proprietary product. If handled badly, it can hurt
      your company's reputation in other open-source projects you
      sponsor or participate in--developers will question your
      company's commitment to open source. You can also expect news
      stories reporting your company's change in focus.</p>

      <p>Naturally, how damaging such a reduction in support can be
      depends on the size and prominence of the project. If it is
      something as large as IBM's support for Eclipse, then
      reducing commitment will probably be written about in the
      mainstream press, whereas if it's a small company with a
      small project, there might be hardly any notice taken outside
      that project's community. The community surrounding even a
      trivial project, however, can be vocal and influential beyond
      the apparent importance of the project itself, and it is
      sometimes hard to know for sure who is watching the project.
      So be wary of how you try to reduce your company's
      commitment.</p>

      <p>Because of the potential for damage to your company's
      reputation, it is important to have an approval process in
      place to review any decreases in your participation in
      publicly visible open-source projects. The last thing your
      CEO wants is for the press to announce that your company is
      making major changes in strategy all because some low-level
      manager has laid off or transferred the employees most
      visible to one of your open-source projects. We've seen this
      happen--a company laid off the employee providing the
      technological leadership for one of their open-source
      projects--along with the subsequent damage control the
      company needed to recover from it.</p>

      <p>If you want to minimize the negative impact of reducing
      your commitment to an open-source project that your company
      sponsors, the questions that must be answered include the
      following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Is this a decrease in effort, or are you ending your
        participation in the project?</li>

        <li>How will it be announced?</li>

        <li>What will the public perception of the reduction
        be?</li>

        <li>How will the community of the open-source project
        react?</li>

        <li>How will this affect other open-source projects your
        company is participating in?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you are ending your sponsorship of the project, there
      must be a plan and schedule for disengaging. You will need to
      answer the following additional questions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Who from the community will take over the project?</li>

        <li>Where will the project's website be hosted? How will
        any transition take place?</li>

        <li>What obligations do you need to fulfill (for example,
        continuing to post the source code)?</li>

        <li>Is it okay for your developers to continue to
        participate on their own time if they wish to?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Making sure all of these questions have satisfactory
      answers before taking any public actions should minimize any
      possible harm to your company and keep the respect of the
      open-source world.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="what-about-small-projects-or-end-of-life-products">
      <h2>What about Small Projects or End-of-Life Products?</h2>

      <p>For a small project, all of this may seem like overkill.
      However, the same steps must be followed whether you are
      releasing 500 lines of code or 500,000. Of course, it is much
      easier to do due diligence on 500 lines of source code so it
      can be released.</p>

      <p>To be successful, open source requires fostering a
      community around the code, and that takes work. At a minimum,
      someone who understands the code must filter suggested
      changes and help developers work with it. It also requires an
      archived mailing list or newsgroup and at least a handful of
      web pages, including one that lets people download the source
      code and executable versions.</p>

      <p>Most open-source projects are fairly small, consisting of
      fewer than 20 developers and several hundred users. So, the
      effort required is only the discussion and coding needed to
      move the project along. As long as the user community is
      happy with the rate of progress, the project is alive and
      healthy. For a mature project there may not be many, if any,
      changes being made to the code--the community will stay
      healthy from active discussions on how to best use the
      software.</p>

      <p>Because a small project will have a limited budget (and an
      EOL project may have no budget), it will probably not be able
      to afford to have a dedicated website. If your company
      already has a website for small company-sponsored open-source
      projects, then you can host your project there. For example,
      a number of smaller Sun open-source projects are hosted at
      SunSource.net.<sup><a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id=
      "fnref16" name="fnref16">16</a></sup> If your company does
      not have such a website then you will need to use a free
      website provider, such as SourceForge.<sup><a href="#fn17"
      class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17" name=
      "fnref17">17</a></sup></p>

      <p>For EOLed code that is no longer being supported, but that
      you don't want to die, the amount of effort needed to make it
      open source may seem to be orders of magnitude more than the
      work you expect your group will put into the code in the
      future. Remember that open source is not magic: It takes a
      lot of work to create a community and make an open-source
      project successful. You will still need to determine an
      appropriate license for the software. To give a community a
      chance to grow, you should expect that you will need to
      commit one or two engineers for at least a year to engage
      with the community and to continue working on the code.</p>

      <p>For a product that you are about to stop supporting, you
      may just want to provide the source code to current customers
      so they can continue to use it. That is, you want to keep
      your customers happy even though you are discontinuing the
      product, but you are not interested in creating a community.
      In such a case, it may be sufficient to make the source code
      and supporting material, such as build scripts and internal
      documentation, available for download on your regular
      corporate website. You should also make sure that there is an
      email list or forum set up so that your customers can help
      each other--plan for some of your engineers to participate on
      that list.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="problems-you-can-expect-to-encounter">
      <h2>Problems You Can Expect to Encounter</h2>

      <p>Once you have approval for your project and have begun
      open-source development, there are a number of problems that
      you are likely to encounter. We end this chapter by
      discussing some of the more common ones along with ways to
      handle them. These difficulties crop up in virtually every
      open-source project just because of how people act when they
      try to collaborate. These are the problems that you'll see
      even when you do everything right. There is a whole other
      class of problems that results from mistakes being made in
      how an open-source project is run, which we cover in Chapter
      9.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="getting-engagement">
      <h2>Getting Engagement</h2>

      <p>The first problem you may face when you start up your
      open-source project is that no one seems to care about it--no
      potential users download your application to try it out;
      perhaps no one even visits your project's website. If so, you
      need to publicize your project, telling people how and why it
      helps them. See the section on <a href=
      "IHE-67.html#12450">Marketing Your Project</a> in Chapter 8
      for suggestions on ways to do this.</p>

      <p>Another problem you may encounter is that once you start
      getting users, only a few bug reports or contributions are
      submitted. People are downloading your application and, you
      hope, using it, but they are not providing the feedback or
      improvements you had hoped for. It may be because it just
      takes time for a community to develop, but it also may be
      that you are discouraging outside participation. Some things
      that you can do to increase participation are described in
      the section <a href="IHE-68.html#63158">Focus on Your Users
      and Contributors</a> in Chapter 8.</p>

      <p>A third problem you may see is that many user questions
      posted to your project's mailing lists go unanswered. If
      outside individuals are posting only questions to your
      mailing lists and your team is answering all of them, you
      will quickly become overwhelmed trying to answer everybody.
      When you start up the open-source project, tell your
      developers to use the rule of delaying answering a posted
      question for a day or two. This will encourage your users to
      answer them. If a question has not been not answered after a
      day or two, then one of your developers should answer it.
      Typically, the community manager is the one to answer such
      questions, but make sure those you assign are capable of
      answering the more difficult questions asked by your
      intermediate and advanced community members--these members,
      knowing their questions will be answered by one of the
      experts you've assigned, will have a reason to stay on the
      list, and they will be just the ones to provide answers to
      the easier queries. Check the attitude expressed in the
      messages your team posts: Is it arrogant? Does your team
      embarrass people when they are wrong? You need to make the
      mailing list a safe place for people to participate.</p>

      <p>It is very important to build up a community of givers
      rather than takers. Open source is very much a gift economy.
      The more personally connected your team members are with
      other individuals in the community and the more they are
      perceived as giving to and caring about the community, the
      greater will be the community involvement and participation
      in the project. Conversely, if your developers act as if they
      are just doing their jobs, then do not expect much in the way
      of outside volunteers or for a community to develop--at best
      you will have a user group.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="plays-well-with-others">
      <h2>Plays Well with Others</h2>

      <p>Software developers often have strong opinions and are not
      shy about expressing them. Some might even be accused of
      lacking in social skills. When they interact, sparks can fly
      and lots of unproductive flaming can result. In every
      open-source project, there will often be major differences of
      opinion on what is the best architecture or technical
      solution to any given problem. Too many battles can split a
      community, causing some developers to leave to start a
      competing project. To avoid this fate for your project, it is
      important that your developers learn to help arbitrate any
      flame wars that occur. Even when they disagree with some
      community member, they need to keep the conversation civil
      and focus the community on its common goals. Make sure people
      feel they are being heard and that their viewpoint is seen as
      a positive contribution to the project even if it is not the
      direction chosen. Figure out a way to explicitly recognize
      and reward those of your team who douse flames well.</p>

      <p>A related problem is that some discussions never seem to
      resolve: Various viewpoints get expressed, but no solution is
      agreed on. In some projects, the project founder or a module
      owner plays the role of final decision maker. In other
      projects, there is no one individual in charge. For those
      other projects, each issue needs to have a person assigned to
      bring it to conclusion--often this is the person who brought
      up the issue or the one who will undertake implementing
      whatever solution is chosen. It might also be a person with
      good project management skills, who can listen to what
      developers are saying. This person needs to follow-up on each
      issue raised during the discussion, get a sense of how the
      community feels about each, and summarize matters when the
      discussion winds down or when nothing new is being said. The
      summary should indicate what was decided and who will do any
      associated work to implement it.</p>

      <p>The decision about an issue can also falter because only a
      few people participate in the discussion. It might be
      necessary to solicit the opinions of specific community
      members who are knowledgeable on the particular issue. Lack
      of discussion may also indicate that the community does not
      consider the issue to be important, and so the appropriate
      decision might be to do nothing for now.</p>

      <p>Sometimes there will be lots of noise on the project's
      mailing lists, often by people who think they know more than
      they actually do or who have an extreme viewpoint--noise in
      the form of extended discussion on how to approach a
      particular problem or a new idea about what to add or a
      direction to go. There will always be some noise like this on
      the lists, but too much can drive valued community members
      away. However, it's important to consider whether some
      discussion really is noise or whether it is important
      information that differs from the prejudices of the main
      project developers--sometimes it is hard to tell the
      difference. Often the best solution is to suggest that those
      in favor of the new idea should create a new subproject and
      implement a prototype. This at least moves the discussion to
      another list and your community might be pleasantly surprised
      when they get to see the idea put into practice. As for those
      few folks who continue to send flames, you may need to send
      them a private message asking them what's going on and to
      please tone it down--sometimes they don't realize that they
      are acting inappropriately.</p>

      <p>Managing community expectations is another common problem.
      No matter how much you do, you can count on people requesting
      additional features--in fact you want them to. Some of these
      requests will be for things that everyone agrees would be
      great, whereas others may be more questionable or not fit
      with the project's main direction. In any case, your company
      has only so many employees who can work on your project, so
      there will always be more than you can do. It is very
      important that you establish a community of peers where it is
      taken for granted that anyone can and does contribute to the
      project. In such a community, the person who proposes a new
      feature is a logical choice for who should implement it.
      Although some open-source projects adopt the attitude that
      anyone who proposes a change or feature must "show me the
      code," you shouldn't fall prey to it. Sometimes a gifted
      designer or someone who understands the user community very
      well is not a gifted coder, and you should encourage outside
      developers to work with such people. What you do not want is
      a community where everyone expects that all significant work
      will be done only by your company. When there is a feature
      that you do not wish to have your employees work on, you want
      the community's energies directed at implementing the feature
      itself, not at trying to convince you to do so.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="dealing-with-your-own-company">
      <h2>Dealing with Your Own Company</h2>

      <p>Sometimes it's not just the community outside your company
      that insists on telling you what to do. Sometimes other
      groups inside your own company demand that you add features
      for them that you either do not have the resources to do or
      that clash with the publicly stated road map of your project.
      The more you can encourage other parts of your company to
      actively participate through the open-source process, the
      better. Once other groups learn that they can submit bug
      fixes and new features directly, they will understand that
      they can control their own schedules and not be dependent on
      your group. This is the same form of risk reduction that a
      company enjoys when it has a source-code escrow agreement
      with a supplier or it uses an open-source solution and the
      original supplier or support company is unresponsive or goes
      out of business: The source code can be fixed and improved
      without the intercession of the original development group.
      In this way, open source can reduce risks for other parts of
      your company.</p>

      <p>If your current managers have problems resolving disputes
      among your developers, then making your project open source
      can make things worse. As already mentioned, the open-source
      method of making decisions via public discussion on project
      mailing lists often does not reach a clear consensus. If your
      own developers do not agree with the direction the project is
      taking, they can air their objections in the public
      discussion and use the ensuing uncertainty to block others
      from taking action. It is important that your developers be
      able to express themselves freely on the project mailing
      lists, but you do not want them using those discussions to
      further their private agendas. This can sometimes be a tough
      call, and it requires that your project managers be willing
      to step in when necessary and make decisions about what your
      company's developers should be working on. An example of this
      problem that we've seen occur is when a developer who does
      not want to implement what a user-interface designer has
      proposed uses disagreements with the proposal on the mailing
      lists as a reason to do whatever that developer prefers. In a
      traditional proprietary project, the developer would not have
      a choice, but would need to implement what the UI expert
      thought best.</p>

      <p>Another common problem occurs when there is a change in
      management in your company and your new management doesn't
      understand open source. If this happens, you need to
      immediately start to educate them about open source and make
      it clear how your use of open source helps your company. If
      your old manager can help explain why open source makes
      sense, so much the better. A failure on your part to sell
      your new management on the value of open source can have
      disastrous consequences, both when resource decisions need to
      be made and when you and your project come up for review.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="contributing-to-other-projects">
      <h2>Contributing to Other Projects</h2>

      <p>The last problem we consider here is you as an individual
      having trouble getting your contributions accepted when you
      are participating in an open-source project that is run by
      someone else. You've fixed a major bug or written some nifty
      new feature, but you cannot get the open-source project to
      accept it. It can be very frustrating when you are trying to
      help, but are being ignored.</p>

      <p>There are several reasons why this may be the case. The
      first is that the community might not know you. If this is
      your first contribution, then people will be wondering who
      you are and why should they pay any attention to what you
      say. It is very important that you build up your reputation
      with the community by helping to fix small bugs and
      participating in discussions. Contributions that show people
      that you are competent and that affirm that you share in the
      project's goals will give you standing in the community. Only
      then will people be willing to listen to you when you make
      suggestions that go beyond the current project road map. You
      and the rest of your team may be the authorities within your
      company, but unless you are also world famous, you will need
      to establish a track record through your participation in the
      open-source project. It's not just a question of your
      competency, but also one of trust. This is especially
      important because companies are often viewed suspiciously and
      many will assume your company is trying somehow through you
      to rip off the work done by the open-source community. You
      need to demonstrate that you, as an individual, are someone
      the community can trust.</p>

      <p>Another reason your contribution may not be accepted is
      that your proposed solution is not seen by the community as
      adding any value. This may be because you are concerned about
      a different set of issues--for example, you may be extending
      the software to work in a complex enterprise setting, whereas
      the project's focus is on an individual using a single
      machine; or you may be interested in making the software more
      usable by novices, whereas the community is mostly expert
      power users. It's up to you to convince the community
      members--or at least the relevant module owner--that what you
      are proposing has value. In any such discussion, you should
      listen carefully to any objections raised by the community.
      It is very likely that you will need to modify your proposed
      solution to take the community's concerns into account. You
      should start this dialog as soon as you know that you need to
      fix some bug or add some feature, well before you write any
      code. If you wait until after you have all the code written
      and then surprise the community with it, you will probably be
      the one surprised.</p>

      <p>For more discussion see the section <a href=
      "IHE-57.html#13471">Getting Your Contributions Accepted</a>
      in Chapter 6.</p>

      <p>You may find that the project or module owner isn't
      responding to your email messages. Remember that a lot of
      open-source developers are volunteers, so they may be busy
      with their real jobs or other work, they might be on
      vacation, or they may be temporarily burned out on open
      source. By looking at the traffic on the project's mailing
      lists and in the mail archives, you should be able to
      determine whether the project owner is ignoring just you or
      is simply not currently active at all. Also, as previously
      mentioned, if no one knows who you are, then on a busy
      mailing list your comments will be easy to overlook,
      especially if they are on a topic far from the project's
      current focus.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="going-with-open-source-1">
      <h2>Going with Open Source</h2>

      <p>Going with open source is not a simple task, nor is it
      inexpensive. Your company should have a clear, long-term
      vision of the business goals of such a project. Because the
      commitment is expensive and lengthy, the primary business
      goals that make sense are strategic ones. If you find
      yourself thinking of using open source as a tactic, you
      should think very hard because when the time for the tactic
      is over, you might have to pay a price out of balance with
      the tactical gain you realized.</p>

      <p>We have provided here a good general idea of the questions
      to ask and considerations to take into account when deciding
      whether to go with open source and preparing to execute the
      decision. If you've read this book and absorbed the
      philosophy, principles, and practices of open source, you
      should be able to work your way through any other questions
      or issues that come up that we haven't covered.</p>
