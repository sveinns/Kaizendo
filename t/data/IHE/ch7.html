  <h1>7. Going with Open Source</h1>

  <p>How and Why open source works was described in the previous
  chapters. In many cases, the idea of using open source originates
  with a project leader or mid-level manager in a company. This
  chapter and the two that follow address such leaders and managers
  more so than executives. Our aim is to help you decide whether
  open source is right for your project and describe steps you
  should take to proceed and missteps to avoid, if you so
  decide.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1" name=
  "fnref1">1</a></sup></p>

  <div id="deciding-to-do-open-source">
    <h2>Deciding to Do Open Source</h2>

    <p>After reading the first six chapters of this book, you are
    in a position to make an intelligent decision about whether
    open source is appropriate for your project. Here are some of
    the questions that you need to answer:</p>
  </div>

  <div id="do-you-buy-the-lifestyle">
    <h2>Do You Buy the Lifestyle?</h2>

    <p>Are you willing to do your work in the open and collaborate
    with people outside your company? Will you use public mailing
    lists instead of internal ones? Are you willing to spend
    significant amounts of time discussing design and direction
    with outside community members? Is everyone working on your
    project willing to work this way? Are your managers (and their
    managers) willing to change how your project is run? Are you
    willing to give up total control and let the community make
    many of the decisions?</p>
  </div>

  <div id="does-your-business-model-support-it">
    <h2>Does your Business Model Support it?</h2>

    <p>What are your business goals? Are you trying to make a
    platform ubiquitous, gain developer mindshare, create a
    for-sale product, sell support or services, or something else?
    How does open source help you achieve these goals? How will
    your business model develop over time? Do you need to provide
    support for your product? If so, how will you support it?</p>
  </div>

  <div id="can-you-legally-open-source-your-code">
    <h2>Can you Legally Open source Your Code?</h2>

    <p>Does your company own the rights to all of your source code?
    Does it include any third-party code? Does it use any
    third-party intellectual property (such as patents or trade
    secrets)?</p>

    <p>Who is your target audience? Why will these people care
    about your project? What do they get out of it? What licenses
    are they currently using for related projects? Will your
    license be compatible with theirs? Will you be competing with
    an existing open-source project? Is there a working version of
    your code that people can use right now?</p>
  </div>

  <div id="is-your-source-code-open-source-friendly">
    <h2>Is Your Source Code Open-Source-Friendly?</h2>

    <p>Large monolithic and poorly documented applications require
    lots of study before a developer can make even a small change.
    How easy is it for new people to learn their way around your
    code base? Is your code modular? Is there sufficient
    documentation? Are you willing to refactor the code? Are the
    main developers of the code willing to answer questions?</p>
  </div>

  <div id="can-you-get-the-resources">
    <h2>Can You Get the Resources?</h2>

    <p>Doing open source requires some basic infrastructure. Can
    you provide the people to maintain the CVS archive, project
    mailing lists and archives, website, and bug database? Can you
    support a community coordinator, a website editor, and a
    buildmaster? Do you have a budget to design and host your
    project's website?</p>
  </div>

  <div id="do-you-have-realistic-and-measurable-goals">
    <h2>Do You Have Realistic and Measurable Goals?</h2>

    <p>How will you know whether your project is a success? How can
    you convince your managers and others at your company that you
    are achieving your goals? For an open-source project, success
    is more than just when you release and what features were
    implemented. Success includes the health of the community. What
    numbers are meaningful for your project goals (for example,
    market share, number of active outside developers, number of
    user contributions, or amount of email sent to mailing
    lists)?</p>
  </div>

  <div id="what-support-do-you-need-from-your-manager">
    <h2>What Support Do You Need from Your Manager?</h2>

    <p>Is your management willing to allocate sufficient resources?
    Will they assess you on the success of the open-source effort?
    If the open-source community needs more time to make a decision
    or get a release out, is your management willing to slip
    schedules, or must you meet your company's internal schedules
    and deadlines at all costs? How about other managers at your
    company who run projects that depend on your project?</p>
  </div>

  <div id="how-to-prepare-to-do-open-source-at-your-company">
    <h2>How to Prepare to Do Open Source at Your Company</h2>

    <p>If your answers to the previous questions support the use of
    open source for your project, then what? We now discuss some
    steps you can take to create a successful open-source
    project.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="resources-at-your-company-to-help-you">
    <h2>Resources at Your Company to Help You</h2>

    <p>If your company is already participating in open source,
    then there are probably people in the company able to help you
    get started with your new open-source project--it might even be
    part of their job descriptions. Even if your project will be
    your company's first venture into the realm of open source,
    there are still apt to be internal company resources you can
    draw on to help make your project successful.</p>

    <p>Possibly your company has established some sort of
    Open-Source Program Office to help launch and maintain
    company-sponsored open-source projects. This may include one or
    more people whose job is to monitor and advise groups in the
    company in their dealings with the open-source community. They
    can be very helpful in advising you on what license to use,
    negotiating with outside providers to host your project's
    website, training your team, and building the community, for
    example. They may have an internal company website on company
    procedures for open-source-related activities. There might also
    be an internal mailing list to discuss open-source issues.</p>

    <p>Your company's legal department may have some people who
    know about open source, at least from a licensing perspective.
    We say more about legal issues later when we discuss getting
    source code ready to be made public and company policies for
    approving open-source projects.</p>

    <p>You should definitely talk with the folks in any other
    projects within your company that use or develop open source.
    They are the ones who are in the best position to help you
    understand what you are getting yourself into.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="educate-yourself-and-your-team-about-open-source">
    <h2>Educate Yourself and Your Team about Open Source</h2>

    <p>The best way to prepare to do open source is to participate
    in an existing open-source project. You or someone from your
    team should find an open-source project of interest and join
    it. Download the project's code and play with it. Follow the
    mailing lists. Perhaps fix a bug or contribute a small
    modification. Other members of your team should also
    participate in open-source projects that interest them.</p>

    <p>Doing this for a few weeks will give you and your teammates
    a good idea of what an open-source project really feels like.
    You will also gain an appreciation for what it's like to be an
    outsider. Were you treated courteously in your interactions
    with the project's module owners and core developers? Were your
    suggestions and contributions dealt with promptly? Did you feel
    accepted and encouraged? This should give you plenty to think
    about when you are running your own open-source project.</p>

    <p>Another way to learn about the open-source culture firsthand
    is to join discussions on websites such as
    Slashdot.<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"
    name="fnref2">2</a></sup> Read the postings to see the range of
    people who make up the open-source community--from clueless
    newbies to experienced professionals. Post your own comments on
    topics you personally care about. Please avoid flaming. If you
    post with an email address from your company, you might check
    whether your comments are treated specially. Don't feel that
    you always need to defend your company--that's best done by
    people who don't work for your company.</p>

    <p>Not all developers are suited for the open way that
    open-source projects must be run. Getting a taste from
    participating in someone else's project may aid in identifying
    whether you, or someone on your team, is not well-suited for
    open source.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="educate-your-manager-about-open-source">
    <h2>Educate Your Manager about Open Source</h2>

    <p>Developing open-source software is quite different from
    creating proprietary software. You will need the support of
    your manager to succeed. Your manager, and probably his or her
    manager, will also need to understand how open source works
    along with its advantages and disadvantages.</p>

    <p>You need to make sure that your manager does not believe any
    of the various myths and misconceptions about open source (see
    <sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3" name=
    "fnref3">3</a></sup> provide many of the services your
    open-source project will need. They also charge a significant
    fee per year to do so.<sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef"
    id="fnref4" name="fnref4">4</a></sup> In addition to providing
    the computers and software to host your website, the services
    also include a person to check that the community is
    functioning properly and perhaps another person to be the
    website editor. If your project has any special needs, you can
    contract for additional features. For a large project, having
    CollabNet host the website may make sense. Sun uses CollabNet
    to host a number of its sponsored open-source projects such as
    NetBeans and OpenOffice. Note that it can easily take 3-4 weeks
    to finalize a contract for your project, so don't leave
    creating your website until the last minute.</p>

    <p>For its Collaborative Development Program (CDP),
    Hewlett-Packard's printing and imaging division contracted with
    CollabNet to provide web hosting. CDP is a gated community
    where HP's worldwide employees can collaborate on software
    development projects along with HP's business partners and
    customers.</p>

    <p>Sun has a special website called SunSource.net<sup><a href=
    "#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5" name=
    "fnref5">5</a></sup> for smaller Sun-sponsored open-source
    projects. This website is also hosted by CollabNet. Because the
    web infrastructure is shared by a number of projects, the cost
    is much less than setting up and running many separate project
    websites. However, because the infrastructure is shared it is
    harder to add special features for a specific project.</p>

    <p>One benefit of using a company such as CollabNet is that its
    staff includes people with lots of experience with numerous
    open-source projects. They can help train your team in how to
    do open source and how to interact with the open-source
    community. Another benefit is that they know what tools an
    open-source project needs and they provide them as part of
    their basic offering. Be aware, however, that they may not be
    able to provide support for additional features or to customize
    your project's pages. Be sure to check out several open-source
    projects that they host to determine whether they provide the
    features that you want for your project.</p>

    <div id="use-a-free-open-source-project-hosting-site">
      <h3>Use a Free Open-Source-Project Hosting Site</h3>

      <p>Because many open-source projects are composed largely of
      developers working in their free time with no sponsoring
      organization, websites have sprung up, such as VA Software
      Corporation's SourceForge<sup><a href="#fn6" class=
      "footnoteRef" id="fnref6" name="fnref6">6</a></sup> or the
      Free Software Foundation's Savannah,<sup><a href="#fn7"
      class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7" name="fnref7">7</a></sup>
      that provide free hosting of open-source projects. This is
      great for developers and projects with no budgets, but it
      means you are limited to whatever basic features the hosting
      organization provides, which may include banner ads on your
      web pages. For a small project with limited resources,
      SourceForge or Savannah may be the only possible
      alternative.</p>

      <p>For a small project that may not be very visible, having
      it live on a website that lots of open-source developers
      regularly visit can only improve your chances of potential
      volunteers stumbling across your project. Be sure to include
      a complete description of your project when you register it
      so that anyone searching through the current projects can
      find yours.</p>

      <p>In summer 2004, there were over 83,000 projects hosted on
      SourceForge and over 2000 on Savannah.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="do-it-yourself">
      <h3>Do It Yourself</h3>

      <p>Many of the large well-known open-source projects, such as
      Apache and Mozilla, are self-hosted. Project volunteers
      maintain and support all the infrastructure for the website,
      CVS tree, bug database, and mailing lists.</p>

      <p>Versions of all the tools needed to host an open-source
      project are themselves available as open source. So if you
      choose to, you can do it yourself and set up your own
      website. You will need either to have use of a company-owned
      web server outside your corporate firewall or to contract
      with a company that does web hosting. You then do all the
      work to set up web pages, mailing lists, CVS trees, and your
      bug database. The website for Jini.org was at one point run
      on a workstation owned by the Jini group and collocated at
      Best.com. The IBM subsidiary that originally developed the
      code that became the Eclipse project originally hosted the
      Eclipse website alongside the subsidiary's public
      website.</p>

      <p>It is also possible to buy versions of the software used
      by the open-source-project hosting websites mentioned: VA
      Software sells SourceForge and CollabNet sells its successor
      to SourceCast--called CollabNet Enterprise Edition--to
      companies to set up for their external open-source projects
      or for internal open-source or gated communities. An
      open-source version of SourceForge called Gforge<sup><a href=
      "#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8" name=
      "fnref8">8</a></sup> is also available.</p>

      <p>If you host your project's website on one of your
      company's web servers, then there are several potential
      problems you need to watch out for. First, and most
      important: make sure your open-source project is distinct
      from the corporate website. In order to create a real
      community, you need to give your project's web pages a look
      and feel that is different from those of your company's web
      pages. Ideally, your project will have its own domain name
      and not use a URL that includes your company's domain name.
      Check that your company's policy is flexible enough to let
      your project have its own flavor.</p>

      <p>Next, you need to check your company's policy on the types
      of materials that can be posted on a company-sponsored
      website. The needs of an open-source project are quite
      different from those of a corporate website. Posting
      third-party content is often avoided on a corporate website,
      but it is the lifeblood of a successful open-source project.
      Make sure that keeping an archive of messages sent by
      community members, which might include comments critical of
      your company or one of your competitors, is all right. Check
      that contributions from the community can be made available
      as downloadable files. How involved will your company's legal
      people be in approving what goes on your website (such as,
      liability issues, use of trademarks, and compliance with
      export regulations)? Will you be more restricted by being
      hosted on one of your company's web servers than if you had
      contracted with an external web-hosting company?</p>

      <p>Third, find out whether you can directly edit your website
      or whether someone in your company's IT department must do
      this. Having your IT department maintain your web server is a
      major plus, but if the result is that minor changes take
      weeks to enact that won't work very well.</p>

      <p>Some projects combine the do-it-yourself approach with the
      use of one of the free open-source-hosting websites. For
      example, JBoss, an open-source Java application server
      project, has its own website<sup><a href="#fn9" class=
      "footnoteRef" id="fnref9" name="fnref9">9</a></sup> with
      project information and discussion forums, but relies on
      SourceForge<sup><a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id=
      "fnref10" name="fnref10">10</a></sup> to provide its CVS
      tree, bug database, file downloading, and task
      management.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div id="making-use-of-an-existing-website">
    <h2>Making Use of an Existing Website</h2>

    <p>If you are joining an existing open-source project, then you
    will probably be able to use the project's website and not have
    to create a new site of your own. If you are joining in on the
    work of ongoing modules, then all of the mailing lists, CVS
    archives, and bug databases should already exist; you just need
    to subscribe to the mailing lists and start contributing.</p>

    <p>If you are developing new modules, then you will probably
    need a new mailing list for each module. If it is a large
    project, then it very likely that there is an easy (possibly
    automated) way to create a new subproject, complete with
    archived mailing lists and a directory in the CVS tree. Some
    open-source efforts, such as Apache, require that you either be
    a member of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) or have a
    member's sponsorship in order to start a new subproject.</p>

    <p>Adding a new subproject to an existing website generally
    will not put a strain on the site's resources. If you expect
    your project will be a significant burden due to the size of
    the code base or the traffic on the discussion lists, then you
    might want to consider donating server machines or making a
    monetary contribution. Talk to the website maintainers and find
    out what they need to make the website better. It's always good
    to volunteer resources, but don't assume they will be accepted
    (for example, a Linux-based website will probably not be
    interested in a Solaris-based web server). Having your company
    listed as a supporter of the website is also a plus.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="your-website-needs-an-editor-in-chief">
    <h2>Your Website Needs an Editor-in-Chief</h2>

    <p>Your project may be making great progress as developers work
    on the source code, but, if no one is reporting the
    improvements on your website and general mailing lists, then to
    the outside world your project will look dead. A stale website
    will turn people away, so you need to have someone assigned to
    keep the website home page up-to-date with the latest project
    news. You want your website to attract both users and potential
    developers. The larger your project, the more important it is
    to have a person whose job it is to let everyone know what's
    happening. Editing the website may be part of the community
    coordinator's job.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="cross-linking-with-your-companys-web-pages">
    <h2>Cross-Linking with Your Company's Web Pages</h2>

    <p>You should have pointers to your project's web pages from
    appropriate places on your company's main website. For example,
    on IBM's website,<sup><a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id=
    "fnref11" name="fnref11">11</a></sup> the IBM WebSphere Studio
    Workbench product web pages have pointers to the Eclipse
    website,<sup><a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"
    name="fnref12">12</a></sup> and on Sun's website<sup><a href=
    "#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13" name=
    "fnref13">13</a></sup> the Sun Java Studio product web pages
    have links to the NetBeans website.<sup><a href="#fn14" class=
    "footnoteRef" id="fnref14" name="fnref14">14</a></sup> The
    editor of your website should coordinate with the people
    managing your company's website so that it has up-to-date news
    of your project. Often, when your project is first announced
    there will be lots of stories and links on several of your
    company's web pages, but months later nothing will have
    changed. Stale references make it seem as if your project has
    not progressed.</p>

    <p>You also should make sure that any link from your
    open-source website back to a commercial website is
    appropriate. Having a banner ad for Sun on the NetBeans website
    would be in very bad taste, as would giving Sun preferential
    treatment with links to Sun products. However, having a page of
    links to companies offering commercial NetBeans plug-in
    modules, including ones from Sun, would be okay.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="getting-approval-from-your-company">
    <h2>Getting Approval from Your Company</h2>

    <p>Before you can announce your open-source project to the
    world, you have one last hurdle to clear: getting official
    approval from your company. Working with open source is similar
    to introducing a new product or making use of another company's
    proprietary code. In both cases, your company is making a legal
    agreement that can limit future choices and create future
    obligations. This is all part of normal business and so your
    company should have an established procedure for approving the
    use of open source in company activities. Just as most
    companies require approval before a new product is introduced
    or an old product is retired, there should be an official
    approval process to create a new open-source project or end
    participation in an existing one.</p>

    <p>A small company might do this casually, whereas a larger
    company will probably have a formal approval process. If you've
    done all of the steps mentioned so far in this chapter, then
    you should have answers to the questions that will be asked
    during the approval process, and you should have no trouble
    getting your project approved.</p>

    <p>Most companies will have different approval procedures
    depending on whether a project is intended to create a new
    open-source project to release source code developed internally
    (outbound open source) or whether code from an existing
    open-source project will be used in-house or incorporated into
    one of the company's products (inbound open source). There may
    be still a third process to approve joining an existing
    open-source project, where you plan to both contribute
    company-developed source code and make use of externally
    developed code.</p>

    <p>Your company should also have an approval process for
    employees who are working on an open-source project as
    individuals on their own time. Although this is primarily to
    protect that individual and the open-source project they are
    participating in, it can also benefit your company by
    signalling its support for open source.</p>

    <p>Finally, there needs to be an approval process for stopping
    work on an open-source project or decreasing the company
    resources allocated to it. Just as every company needs to
    control how it ends the life of a product, similar end-of-life
    (EOL) considerations apply to stopping work on an open-source
    project.</p>

    <p>Different issues and concerns are important for each of
    these situations; we discuss each in turn. Note that each
    company will have its own process, so you need to contact your
    company's legal department for details of your company's
    policy.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="who-should-be-approving-open-source-activities">
    <h2>Who Should Be Approving Open-Source Activities?</h2>

    <p>Because of the possibly serious implications and
    requirements associated with both inbound and outbound open
    source, it is important that any approval body consist of
    executives at the same level as those who approve new products.
    The approval board should include senior executives from
    development, marketing, product planning, and legal. The
    reviewing team may include the head of your business unit.</p>

    <p>It is vital that the approval of a company-sponsored
    open-source project come from a level higher than that of the
    manager who will be running the project, and it should come
    from a level above all of the groups that will be affected by
    the project.</p>

    <p>If you are creating a new approval process for your company,
    be sure to announce it to everyone who might be involved.
    Especially when it comes to downloading source code from the
    Internet, many engineers may not realize that they are
    potentially exposing the company to harm.</p>

    <p>Creating a new open-source project is almost like releasing
    a new product--it consumes company resources, its quality
    reflects on your company, and it implies a certain commitment.
    If you start a new project and it fails, this will probably
    generate bad publicity for and bad will toward your company.
    The approval process needs to weed out the badly conceived
    projects and make sure that proposed projects have not
    neglected anything important.</p>

    <p>There are two parts to a basic approval process for creating
    a new open-source project: a business analysis to explain your
    business strategy and make the case for doing open source and
    due diligence to guarantee that the source code does not
    include any embarrassing comments or third-party encumbrances.
    Only after both steps have been successfully completed can the
    project be started. In fact, no announcement of your company's
    intent to release the code should be made until both steps have
    been completed.</p>

    <div id="requirements-for-the-business-analysis">
      <h3>Requirements for the Business Analysis</h3>

      <p>The business analysis should require you to examine two
      main areas: the suitability of the source code for public
      distribution and the strategic significance for your company
      of releasing the code.</p>

      <p>Steps for determining suitability include the
      following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Identifying the source code.</li>

        <li>Determining what stage of development the code is
        in--is it mature code?</li>

        <li>Confirming that the source code is free of
        viruses.</li>

        <li>Confirming that there is adequate documentation.</li>

        <li>Confirming that the source code is sufficiently modular
        and buildable that outside developers will be able to use
        it.</li>

        <li>Identifying the engineers who will participate on the
        due-diligence team.</li>

        <li>Identifying the employees who will interact with the
        community created by the new open-source project and
        confirming that they all understand how to interact.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Steps for determining strategic significance include the
      following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Listing the business goals for making the source code
        public.</li>

        <li>Identifying the audience/community that will use the
        code.</li>

        <li>Identifying the factors critical to the success of the
        effort, including the resources needed.</li>

        <li>Specifying which licensing model your project will
        use.</li>

        <li>Identifying what the financial impact on your company
        will be.</li>

        <li>Specifying a schedule for the project, including the
        target date to announce the release of the source
        code.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This information should be reviewed by your approval
      board, and if they decide that there are suitable business
      reasons for using open source, then you need to start the due
      diligence process.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="requirements-for-due-diligence">
      <h3>Requirements for Due Diligence</h3>

      <p>Due diligence includes a review of the source code and
      documentation by your company's legal and technical staff to
      determine whether any third-party technology or proprietary
      information has been incorporated into the source code you
      are planning to release. This is done by examining the source
      code thoroughly to determine the origin of each part. Any
      code not developed by your company must be checked to
      determine whether it is under a license that allows you to
      include it in a public release, and, if not, the code must be
      replaced or relicensed.</p>

      <p>The due diligence effort also includes the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Confirming that appropriate copyright, trademark, and
        patent filings have been made.</li>

        <li>Determining whether there are any export
        restrictions.</li>

        <li>Removing any inappropriate, derogatory, or offensive
        statements or references in the source code.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Upon successful completion of the due diligence process,
      the approval board that reviewed the business analysis should
      either approve the project itself or pass a recommendation to
      an appropriate senior executive for final approval. Once the
      project has been approved, you may announce the project and
      release the source code.</p>

  <h2>Getting Approval To Use Source Code Developed Outside Your
  Company</h2>

    <p>If you are planning on downloading source code that has been
    released under an open-source license, then before you can
    incorporate that code into a company product or use it
    internally you will first need to get company approval. This is
    to ensure that your business unit, any affected functional
    groups (for example, support), and your upper management are
    making informed decisions when they acknowledge and accept the
    risks and obligations dictated by the license that the
    downloaded code uses.</p>

    <p>These risks include the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>No warranties, which means that if the source code
      infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party,
      your company could be required to stop shipping products
      containing the downloaded code and could be forced to pay
      monetary damages.</li>

      <li>No support, so, if needed, your company must resolve
      performance, customer support and maintenance,
      internationalization, and localization issues. (Of course,
      providing support for an open-source product can be an
      excellent business opportunity.)</li>

      <li>Limits on what your company can do with a product based
      on the open-source code, which means that your company may
      not be able to release a larger work under a desired
      license.</li>

      <li>Additional requirements on your company, such as that all
      source code in any derived work must be made publicly
      available.</li>

      <li>Indiscriminate dissemination of the downloaded source
      code within your company, which could permit it to be
      unknowingly used in some other, inappropriate company
      product.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The approval process needs to review the business case for
    using the downloaded code, including how these risks will be
    minimized or handled. Issues that must be addressed fall into
    three main categories: business analysis, strategic analysis,
    and legal review.</p>

    <div id="business-analysis">
      <h3>Business Analysis</h3>

      <p>First you must do the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Identify and describe the technology you wish to
        use.</li>

        <li>Explain the strategic significance of the technology:
        What gap does it fill? What is its benefit to your company?
        What alternatives are there?</li>

        <li>Identify which of your company's products will use the
        technology and how they will use it: Will it be embedded in
        the product or just bundled with it? If embedded, will the
        downloaded code be used as is or will it be modified?</li>

        <li>Describe how your company will distribute the
        technology (for example, in source or binary): Will the
        technology's functionality be segregated from your
        company's proprietary code?</li>

        <li>State whether there will be any license fees or
        royalties for the company products that will include the
        technology.</li>

        <li>Explain how the technology will be maintained and
        supported.</li>

        <li>Describe the proposed licensing model for any of your
        company products developed using the downloaded source
        code.</li>

        <li>Estimate the difficulty and the time required to remove
        or replace the downloaded technology if that should become
        necessary.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="strategic-analysis">
      <h3>Strategic Analysis</h3>

      <p>Next, someone from your company's corporate strategy and
      planning department must do the following:</p>

      <p>Ensure that your company's strategic rationale and
      business purposes for downloading the technology are
      consistent with your company's long-term technical and
      business objectives.</p>

      <p>Check with your company's support division that the
      appropriate support and engineering resources are available
      to support the downloaded source code once it has been
      embedded in one of your company's products.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="legal-review">
      <h3>Legal Review</h3>

      <p>And, finally, your legal department needs to do the
      following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Identify licensing requirements, such as needing to
        publish the modified source code.</li>

        <li>Identify any legal risks associated with using the
        downloaded technology.</li>

        <li>Identify any steps or measures to minimize the risks or
        to comply with the licensing requirements.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Once you have the information required by these steps, the
      approval board can review matters. Only after approval is
      granted can the downloaded source code be incorporated into a
      company product. Once it has, your group will be responsible
      for making sure that your company complies with any
      requirements imposed by the download license.</p>

      <p>Several groups in a company might want to use a specific
      downloaded technology--especially one used only internally
      and not in any company products, such as Emacs, Apache, or
      Tomcat. For these cases, it might make sense to create a
      fast-track approval process that can be used to quickly
      approve requests to use downloaded software that has already
      been fully reviewed. The only thing that needs to be checked
      is that the software will be used the same way.</p>

      <p>It may also be possible to automatically approve software
      downloaded for an employee's individual use, such as a
      calendar manager, address book, news reader, or web browser.
      The key point here is that the employee is not modifying or
      redistributing the software. But even in these cases it is
      important to check that the license used by the software does
      not preclude its commercial use, the use of the software as
      part of an individual's job.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div id=
  "getting-approval-to-participate-in-an-existing-open-source-project">
  <h2>Getting Approval To Participate In An Existing Open-source
  Project</h2>

    <p>If you are planning on having your company's employees
    participate in an existing open-source project, then before
    they can do any work with it you need to get the proper
    approval. This approval process will probably be similar to
    that for participating in a joint effort with another company
    or an industry consortium. In some cases, all that may be
    required is that the direct managers give their approval to the
    participating engineers. For example, a small, focused effort
    by one of your engineers to help an open-source project adapt
    its code to run well with one of your company's products should
    not require a heavyweight approval process.</p>

    <p>If code previously developed by your company will be
    contributed to the project or if the code developed by the
    project will be incorporated into one of your company's
    products, then one, or both, of the previous policies may apply
    and require an additional approval process.</p>

    <p>The steps that should be followed before any of your company
    engineers may participate involve the details of the
    open-source project such as the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Describe the overall open-source project.</li>

      <li>Determine the primary reasons that your company should
      participate.</li>

      <li>Determine the precise goals and objectives for your
      company personnel working on the project.</li>

      <li>Determine which open-source license the project
      uses.</li>

      <li>Determine how IP is handled. Does the project allow
      contributors to retain copyright on contributed code?</li>

      <li>Identify other companies participating in the
      project.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are also steps involving risks to your company's
    intellectual property rights, as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Identify the procedures you will put in place to prevent
      any of the open-source code developed by your company
      personnel from subsequently getting mixed with your company's
      proprietary code.</li>

      <li>Determine the likelihood that your company personnel
      developing open-source code will later be asked to develop
      similar functionality in your company's proprietary
      code.</li>

      <li>Determine whether any existing company patents fall
      within the scope of the project.</li>

      <li>Outline the steps you will take while working on the
      project to identify possible future patents.</li>

      <li>Determine whether participation in the project will
      increase the risk that company personnel could disclose trade
      secrets.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Once this information has been obtained and your management
    grants approval, then you can start to participate in the
    open-source effort.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="getting-approval-as-an-individual">
    <h2>Getting Approval as an Individual</h2>

    <p>Many software engineers choose to spend part of their
    personal time contributing to open-source projects. By doing
    so, they learn new technologies, get feedback on their coding
    abilities, and otherwise grow and develop. This is a benefit to
    the company they work for because it makes them more valuable
    as employees. However, it can create a problem if their
    open-source work conflicts in some way with the company's
    business.</p>

    <p>A company may have legitimate concerns about work employees
    do in their spare time. If the open-source work is similar to
    an employee's job then there is the danger that the employee
    will disclose proprietary information concerning technical
    ideas or business plans. This could make it impossible to file
    patents on work the company has done. Likewise, the employee
    might inappropriately take ideas or code from the open-source
    project and use it in a company product, thereby tainting
    it.</p>

    <p>Even when an employee's open-source work and normal work
    assignment are in different areas, the company might have a
    product that competes with that of the open-source project.
    That can create a conflict of interest for the employee.</p>

    <p>Many companies require their employees to sign an agreement
    when they are hired that specifies that the company owns
    anything that the employees invent. Students who are receiving
    support from their university may be in a similar situation. If
    the employees or students contribute to an open-source project,
    then their employer may claim ownership of their work. There
    have been several stories reported at places such as Slashdot
    in which this has indeed happened and people had to stop their
    participation in the open-source project and have their code
    removed from it. This is bad for the project, is very bad for
    the individual, and gives the company a bad name. No one
    benefits from a situation like this.</p>

    <p>All these potential problems can be avoided by having a
    simple process for employees to get approval to participate in
    an open-source project. The process should ensure that the
    employees understand company policy regarding intellectual
    property and conflicts of interest. General guidelines should
    be established and communicated to the employees. These
    typically include that any open-source work should be done on
    the employees' own time, should not be done while at work or
    using company equipment, and should not be similar to what
    their normal job duties are. A form amending the original
    employee agreement should be signed by an appropriate-level
    company executive and the employees should receive a copy. The
    form should state that the company gives up any claim to the
    work done by the employees as part of the open-source project
    and that the employees have the right to assign their
    copyrights to the open-source project.</p>

    <p>The need for approval arises largely because of the
    agreement many companies have new employees sign. One
    suggestion from Slashdot is that when starting a new job the
    new employee should rewrite any offending clauses to restrict
    the scope of that agreement. The following is an excerpt from
    that posting:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>A lot of people think they have no negotiating ability.
      You do. When you're thinking of signing on with some company,
      and they send you a boiler-plate contract to sign, don't just
      sign it and send it back. Read it carefully. Alter it as you
      see fit, striking out sections, adding sections, and
      initialing each change. Then sign it, make a copy for
      yourself, and send it back.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Where it says:</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>company owns the rights to all work produced during the
      term of employment</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Just strike it out, and change it to:</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>company owns the rights to code written during working
      hours and in direct furtherance of any tasks assigned by the
      company</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>See how much nicer that reads? Now, when you do this,
      there are two possibilities: either the company will ignore
      it and hire you, or they will object to your alteration of
      the contract.<sup><a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id=
      "fnref15" name="fnref15">15</a></sup></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Many Slashdot posters have described how they did this when
    they started a new job and that their employers had no problem
    with making any reasonable changes.</p>

  <div id=
  "getting-approval-to-stop-or-lessen-participation-in-a-sponsored-open-source-project">
  <h2>Getting Approval To Stop Or Lessen Participation In A
  Sponsored Open-source Project</h2>

    <p>There will come a time when you need to reduce the number of
    people and resources devoted to an open-source project that
    your company has been sponsoring. Because it is an open-source
    project, this is a much more public announcement than reducing
    the number of employees working on some internal proprietary
    product. If handled badly, it can hurt your company's
    reputation in other open-source projects you sponsor or
    participate in--developers will question your company's
    commitment to open source. You can also expect news stories
    reporting your company's change in focus.</p>

    <p>Naturally, how damaging such a reduction in support can be
    depends on the size and prominence of the project. If it is
    something as large as IBM's support for Eclipse, then reducing
    commitment will probably be written about in the mainstream
    press, whereas if it's a small company with a small project,
    there might be hardly any notice taken outside that project's
    community. The community surrounding even a trivial project,
    however, can be vocal and influential beyond the apparent
    importance of the project itself, and it is sometimes hard to
    know for sure who is watching the project. So be wary of how
    you try to reduce your company's commitment.</p>

    <p>Because of the potential for damage to your company's
    reputation, it is important to have an approval process in
    place to review any decreases in your participation in publicly
    visible open-source projects. The last thing your CEO wants is
    for the press to announce that your company is making major
    changes in strategy all because some low-level manager has laid
    off or transferred the employees most visible to one of your
    open-source projects. We've seen this happen--a company laid
    off the employee providing the technological leadership for one
    of their open-source projects--along with the subsequent damage
    control the company needed to recover from it.</p>

    <p>If you want to minimize the negative impact of reducing your
    commitment to an open-source project that your company
    sponsors, the questions that must be answered include the
    following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Is this a decrease in effort, or are you ending your
      participation in the project?</li>

      <li>How will it be announced?</li>

      <li>What will the public perception of the reduction be?</li>

      <li>How will the community of the open-source project
      react?</li>

      <li>How will this affect other open-source projects your
      company is participating in?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you are ending your sponsorship of the project, there
    must be a plan and schedule for disengaging. You will need to
    answer the following additional questions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Who from the community will take over the project?</li>

      <li>Where will the project's website be hosted? How will any
      transition take place?</li>

      <li>What obligations do you need to fulfill (for example,
      continuing to post the source code)?</li>

      <li>Is it okay for your developers to continue to participate
      on their own time if they wish to?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Making sure all of these questions have satisfactory answers
    before taking any public actions should minimize any possible
    harm to your company and keep the respect of the open-source
    world.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="what-about-small-projects-or-end-of-life-products">
    <h2>What about Small Projects or End-of-Life Products?</h2>

    <p>For a small project, all of this may seem like overkill.
    However, the same steps must be followed whether you are
    releasing 500 lines of code or 500,000. Of course, it is much
    easier to do due diligence on 500 lines of source code so it
    can be released.</p>

    <p>To be successful, open source requires fostering a community
    around the code, and that takes work. At a minimum, someone who
    understands the code must filter suggested changes and help
    developers work with it. It also requires an archived mailing
    list or newsgroup and at least a handful of web pages,
    including one that lets people download the source code and
    executable versions.</p>

    <p>Most open-source projects are fairly small, consisting of
    fewer than 20 developers and several hundred users. So, the
    effort required is only the discussion and coding needed to
    move the project along. As long as the user community is happy
    with the rate of progress, the project is alive and healthy.
    For a mature project there may not be many, if any, changes
    being made to the code--the community will stay healthy from
    active discussions on how to best use the software.</p>

    <p>Because a small project will have a limited budget (and an
    EOL project may have no budget), it will probably not be able
    to afford to have a dedicated website. If your company already
    has a website for small company-sponsored open-source projects,
    then you can host your project there. For example, a number of
    smaller Sun open-source projects are hosted at
    SunSource.net.<sup><a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id=
    "fnref16" name="fnref16">16</a></sup> If your company does not
    have such a website then you will need to use a free website
    provider, such as SourceForge.<sup><a href="#fn17" class=
    "footnoteRef" id="fnref17" name="fnref17">17</a></sup></p>

    <p>For EOLed code that is no longer being supported, but that
    you don't want to die, the amount of effort needed to make it
    open source may seem to be orders of magnitude more than the
    work you expect your group will put into the code in the
    future. Remember that open source is not magic: It takes a lot
    of work to create a community and make an open-source project
    successful. You will still need to determine an appropriate
    license for the software. To give a community a chance to grow,
    you should expect that you will need to commit one or two
    engineers for at least a year to engage with the community and
    to continue working on the code.</p>

    <p>For a product that you are about to stop supporting, you may
    just want to provide the source code to current customers so
    they can continue to use it. That is, you want to keep your
    customers happy even though you are discontinuing the product,
    but you are not interested in creating a community. In such a
    case, it may be sufficient to make the source code and
    supporting material, such as build scripts and internal
    documentation, available for download on your regular corporate
    website. You should also make sure that there is an email list
    or forum set up so that your customers can help each
    other--plan for some of your engineers to participate on that
    list.</p>

  <div id="problems-you-can-expect-to-encounter">
    <h2>Problems You Can Expect to Encounter</h2>

    <p>Once you have approval for your project and have begun
    open-source development, there are a number of problems that
    you are likely to encounter. We end this chapter by discussing
    some of the more common ones along with ways to handle them.
    These difficulties crop up in virtually every open-source
    project just because of how people act when they try to
    collaborate. These are the problems that you'll see even when
    you do everything right. There is a whole other class of
    problems that results from mistakes being made in how an
    open-source project is run, which we cover in Chapter 9.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="getting-engagement">
    <h2>Getting Engagement</h2>

    <p>The first problem you may face when you start up your
    open-source project is that no one seems to care about it--no
    potential users download your application to try it out;
    perhaps no one even visits your project's website. If so, you
    need to publicize your project, telling people how and why it
    helps them. See the section on <a href=
    "IHE-67.html#12450">Marketing Your Project</a> in Chapter 8 for
    suggestions on ways to do this.</p>

    <p>Another problem you may encounter is that once you start
    getting users, only a few bug reports or contributions are
    submitted. People are downloading your application and, you
    hope, using it, but they are not providing the feedback or
    improvements you had hoped for. It may be because it just takes
    time for a community to develop, but it also may be that you
    are discouraging outside participation. Some things that you
    can do to increase participation are described in the section
    <a href="IHE-68.html#63158">Focus on Your Users and
    Contributors</a> in Chapter 8.</p>

    <p>A third problem you may see is that many user questions
    posted to your project's mailing lists go unanswered. If
    outside individuals are posting only questions to your mailing
    lists and your team is answering all of them, you will quickly
    become overwhelmed trying to answer everybody. When you start
    up the open-source project, tell your developers to use the
    rule of delaying answering a posted question for a day or two.
    This will encourage your users to answer them. If a question
    has not been not answered after a day or two, then one of your
    developers should answer it. Typically, the community manager
    is the one to answer such questions, but make sure those you
    assign are capable of answering the more difficult questions
    asked by your intermediate and advanced community
    members--these members, knowing their questions will be
    answered by one of the experts you've assigned, will have a
    reason to stay on the list, and they will be just the ones to
    provide answers to the easier queries. Check the attitude
    expressed in the messages your team posts: Is it arrogant? Does
    your team embarrass people when they are wrong? You need to
    make the mailing list a safe place for people to
    participate.</p>

    <p>It is very important to build up a community of givers
    rather than takers. Open source is very much a gift economy.
    The more personally connected your team members are with other
    individuals in the community and the more they are perceived as
    giving to and caring about the community, the greater will be
    the community involvement and participation in the project.
    Conversely, if your developers act as if they are just doing
    their jobs, then do not expect much in the way of outside
    volunteers or for a community to develop--at best you will have
    a user group.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="plays-well-with-others">
    <h2>Plays Well with Others</h2>

    <p>Software developers often have strong opinions and are not
    shy about expressing them. Some might even be accused of
    lacking in social skills. When they interact, sparks can fly
    and lots of unproductive flaming can result. In every
    open-source project, there will often be major differences of
    opinion on what is the best architecture or technical solution
    to any given problem. Too many battles can split a community,
    causing some developers to leave to start a competing project.
    To avoid this fate for your project, it is important that your
    developers learn to help arbitrate any flame wars that occur.
    Even when they disagree with some community member, they need
    to keep the conversation civil and focus the community on its
    common goals. Make sure people feel they are being heard and
    that their viewpoint is seen as a positive contribution to the
    project even if it is not the direction chosen. Figure out a
    way to explicitly recognize and reward those of your team who
    douse flames well.</p>

    <p>A related problem is that some discussions never seem to
    resolve: Various viewpoints get expressed, but no solution is
    agreed on. In some projects, the project founder or a module
    owner plays the role of final decision maker. In other
    projects, there is no one individual in charge. For those other
    projects, each issue needs to have a person assigned to bring
    it to conclusion--often this is the person who brought up the
    issue or the one who will undertake implementing whatever
    solution is chosen. It might also be a person with good project
    management skills, who can listen to what developers are
    saying. This person needs to follow-up on each issue raised
    during the discussion, get a sense of how the community feels
    about each, and summarize matters when the discussion winds
    down or when nothing new is being said. The summary should
    indicate what was decided and who will do any associated work
    to implement it.</p>

    <p>The decision about an issue can also falter because only a
    few people participate in the discussion. It might be necessary
    to solicit the opinions of specific community members who are
    knowledgeable on the particular issue. Lack of discussion may
    also indicate that the community does not consider the issue to
    be important, and so the appropriate decision might be to do
    nothing for now.</p>

    <p>Sometimes there will be lots of noise on the project's
    mailing lists, often by people who think they know more than
    they actually do or who have an extreme viewpoint--noise in the
    form of extended discussion on how to approach a particular
    problem or a new idea about what to add or a direction to go.
    There will always be some noise like this on the lists, but too
    much can drive valued community members away. However, it's
    important to consider whether some discussion really is noise
    or whether it is important information that differs from the
    prejudices of the main project developers--sometimes it is hard
    to tell the difference. Often the best solution is to suggest
    that those in favor of the new idea should create a new
    subproject and implement a prototype. This at least moves the
    discussion to another list and your community might be
    pleasantly surprised when they get to see the idea put into
    practice. As for those few folks who continue to send flames,
    you may need to send them a private message asking them what's
    going on and to please tone it down--sometimes they don't
    realize that they are acting inappropriately.</p>

    <p>Managing community expectations is another common problem.
    No matter how much you do, you can count on people requesting
    additional features--in fact you want them to. Some of these
    requests will be for things that everyone agrees would be
    great, whereas others may be more questionable or not fit with
    the project's main direction. In any case, your company has
    only so many employees who can work on your project, so there
    will always be more than you can do. It is very important that
    you establish a community of peers where it is taken for
    granted that anyone can and does contribute to the project. In
    such a community, the person who proposes a new feature is a
    logical choice for who should implement it. Although some
    open-source projects adopt the attitude that anyone who
    proposes a change or feature must &quot;show me the code,&quot;
    you shouldn't fall prey to it. Sometimes a gifted designer or
    someone who understands the user community very well is not a
    gifted coder, and you should encourage outside developers to
    work with such people. What you do not want is a community
    where everyone expects that all significant work will be done
    only by your company. When there is a feature that you do not
    wish to have your employees work on, you want the community's
    energies directed at implementing the feature itself, not at
    trying to convince you to do so.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="dealing-with-your-own-company">
    <h2>Dealing with Your Own Company</h2>

    <p>Sometimes it's not just the community outside your company
    that insists on telling you what to do. Sometimes other groups
    inside your own company demand that you add features for them
    that you either do not have the resources to do or that clash
    with the publicly stated road map of your project. The more you
    can encourage other parts of your company to actively
    participate through the open-source process, the better. Once
    other groups learn that they can submit bug fixes and new
    features directly, they will understand that they can control
    their own schedules and not be dependent on your group. This is
    the same form of risk reduction that a company enjoys when it
    has a source-code escrow agreement with a supplier or it uses
    an open-source solution and the original supplier or support
    company is unresponsive or goes out of business: The source
    code can be fixed and improved without the intercession of the
    original development group. In this way, open source can reduce
    risks for other parts of your company.</p>

    <p>If your current managers have problems resolving disputes
    among your developers, then making your project open source can
    make things worse. As already mentioned, the open-source method
    of making decisions via public discussion on project mailing
    lists often does not reach a clear consensus. If your own
    developers do not agree with the direction the project is
    taking, they can air their objections in the public discussion
    and use the ensuing uncertainty to block others from taking
    action. It is important that your developers be able to express
    themselves freely on the project mailing lists, but you do not
    want them using those discussions to further their private
    agendas. This can sometimes be a tough call, and it requires
    that your project managers be willing to step in when necessary
    and make decisions about what your company's developers should
    be working on. An example of this problem that we've seen occur
    is when a developer who does not want to implement what a
    user-interface designer has proposed uses disagreements with
    the proposal on the mailing lists as a reason to do whatever
    that developer prefers. In a traditional proprietary project,
    the developer would not have a choice, but would need to
    implement what the UI expert thought best.</p>

    <p>Another common problem occurs when there is a change in
    management in your company and your new management doesn't
    understand open source. If this happens, you need to
    immediately start to educate them about open source and make it
    clear how your use of open source helps your company. If your
    old manager can help explain why open source makes sense, so
    much the better. A failure on your part to sell your new
    management on the value of open source can have disastrous
    consequences, both when resource decisions need to be made and
    when you and your project come up for review.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="contributing-to-other-projects">
    <h2>Contributing to Other Projects</h2>

    <p>The last problem we consider here is you as an individual
    having trouble getting your contributions accepted when you are
    participating in an open-source project that is run by someone
    else. You've fixed a major bug or written some nifty new
    feature, but you cannot get the open-source project to accept
    it. It can be very frustrating when you are trying to help, but
    are being ignored.</p>

    <p>There are several reasons why this may be the case. The
    first is that the community might not know you. If this is your
    first contribution, then people will be wondering who you are
    and why should they pay any attention to what you say. It is
    very important that you build up your reputation with the
    community by helping to fix small bugs and participating in
    discussions. Contributions that show people that you are
    competent and that affirm that you share in the project's goals
    will give you standing in the community. Only then will people
    be willing to listen to you when you make suggestions that go
    beyond the current project road map. You and the rest of your
    team may be the authorities within your company, but unless you
    are also world famous, you will need to establish a track
    record through your participation in the open-source project.
    It's not just a question of your competency, but also one of
    trust. This is especially important because companies are often
    viewed suspiciously and many will assume your company is trying
    somehow through you to rip off the work done by the open-source
    community. You need to demonstrate that you, as an individual,
    are someone the community can trust.</p>

    <p>Another reason your contribution may not be accepted is that
    your proposed solution is not seen by the community as adding
    any value. This may be because you are concerned about a
    different set of issues--for example, you may be extending the
    software to work in a complex enterprise setting, whereas the
    project's focus is on an individual using a single machine; or
    you may be interested in making the software more usable by
    novices, whereas the community is mostly expert power users.
    It's up to you to convince the community members--or at least
    the relevant module owner--that what you are proposing has
    value. In any such discussion, you should listen carefully to
    any objections raised by the community. It is very likely that
    you will need to modify your proposed solution to take the
    community's concerns into account. You should start this dialog
    as soon as you know that you need to fix some bug or add some
    feature, well before you write any code. If you wait until
    after you have all the code written and then surprise the
    community with it, you will probably be the one surprised.</p>

    <p>For more discussion see the section <a href=
    "IHE-57.html#13471">Getting Your Contributions Accepted</a> in
    Chapter 6.</p>

    <p>You may find that the project or module owner isn't
    responding to your email messages. Remember that a lot of
    open-source developers are volunteers, so they may be busy with
    their real jobs or other work, they might be on vacation, or
    they may be temporarily burned out on open source. By looking
    at the traffic on the project's mailing lists and in the mail
    archives, you should be able to determine whether the project
    owner is ignoring just you or is simply not currently active at
    all. Also, as previously mentioned, if no one knows who you
    are, then on a busy mailing list your comments will be easy to
    overlook, especially if they are on a topic far from the
    project's current focus.</p>

  <div id="going-with-open-source-1">
    <h2>Going with Open Source</h2>

    <p>Going with open source is not a simple task, nor is it
    inexpensive. Your company should have a clear, long-term vision
    of the business goals of such a project. Because the commitment
    is expensive and lengthy, the primary business goals that make
    sense are strategic ones. If you find yourself thinking of
    using open source as a tactic, you should think very hard
    because when the time for the tactic is over, you might have to
    pay a price out of balance with the tactical gain you
    realized.</p>

    <p>We have provided here a good general idea of the questions
    to ask and considerations to take into account when deciding
    whether to go with open source and preparing to execute the
    decision. If you've read this book and absorbed the philosophy,
    principles, and practices of open source, you should be able to
    work your way through any other questions or issues that come
    up that we haven't covered.</p>
