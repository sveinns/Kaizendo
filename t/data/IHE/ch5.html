  <h1>5. Licenses</h1>

  <p>Open source is a commons-based activity in which a community
  of people work on a shared artifact, in this case source code.
  Source code is covered by copyright law, which in the United
  States grants copyright to an author immediately upon completion
  of the piece. When copyright law in the United States was first
  written, the duration of protection was 14 years with perhaps an
  opportunity to renew it once. Now copyright extends until the
  death of the author plus 70 years.</p>

  <p>Software enjoys the same protections as any other literary
  work. In addition, software may contain the implementations of
  patented methods--called software patents. Currently, the
  copyright holder retains the right to strict control of the work,
  including copying, derived works, distributions, and public
  performance. Originally, copyright law tried to strike a balance
  between providing an incentive for creators and allowing other
  creators to build on works already created. The expansion of
  copyright protection has been rapid over the last 40 years as
  institutional &quot;content&quot; creators lobbied for expanded
  protection.</p>

  <p>A key to understanding open source as a business strategy is
  coming to terms with the idea that there is a middle ground
  between &quot;all rights reserved&quot; and the public domain. It
  is possible for a holder of intellectual property to carefully
  craft a description of rights the holder wishes to retain and
  freedoms the holder grants to licensees. Think in terms of
  &quot;some rights reserved&quot; or &quot;most rights
  reserved.&quot; Even when source code is visible and even
  downloadable on the Internet, the copyright and patent holders
  retain ownership of the material and, by licensing arrangements,
  control what they wish to control. In fact, copyright and patents
  are in place precisely to encourage people to create, invent, and
  put on display their creations and explain their inventions.</p>

  <p>A good, clear example of this is the VTK project. The project
  provides a simple license as part of the copyright notice--and in
  fact, the term <em>copyright</em> is used the way most
  open-source projects use the term <em>license</em> , and some
  open-source licenses, such as BSD (discussed later), likewise
  state their license terms as part of the copyright notice. The
  VTK directory structure isolates files and classes that contain
  patented algorithms (they are in special subdirectories), and the
  license states that any commercial use of those parts requires
  licenses from the patent holders--and it provides contact
  information for them. The commercial use could be as part of VTK
  or as part of other systems. However, individuals, universities,
  and companies can use the code without special terms as long as
  there is no commercial benefit derived, and the nonpatented parts
  can be used commercially without special licenses.</p>

  <p>This represents an example of how the rights to intellectual
  property have been carved up by one group. Other groups might
  limit the use of patents to software developed as part of the
  open-source project, while uses of those patents in other,
  unrelated software would be restricted or prohibited.</p>

  <p>Naturally, crafting a too restrictive set of rights granted to
  others can stifle the success of an open-source project, but
  there is no need to abandon all property rights. For open source
  to work, the author or copyright holder basically needs to grant
  rights to use, modify, and distribute. This is accomplished
  through licensing, which, although granting rights to others,
  does not transfer ownership in any way, so that the owner of the
  source code can change how the source is licensed in the future,
  can decide not to license it, or can transfer ownership.</p>

  <p>A variety of licenses have been created to meet the different
  needs of open-source projects--the original Berkeley Unix was
  released under the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license,
  Linux and Emacs use the GNU General Public License (GPL), and
  Netscape created the Mozilla Public License (MPL) for its
  browser. Companies such as IBM and Sun have written a variety of
  licenses including the Common Public License (CPL), Sun Industry
  Standards Source License (SISSL), and Sun Community Source
  License (SCSL). Over 50 different licenses have been certified as
  meeting the criteria for open source by the Open Source
  Initiative, a nonprofit corporation dedicated to managing and
  promoting the Open Source Definition,<sup><a href="#fn1" class=
  "footnoteRef" id="fnref1" name="fnref1">1</a></sup> and
  additional types of licenses have been created for use by other
  open-source projects.</p>

  <p>This large number of possible licenses creates confusion for
  people considering starting in an open-source project. When
  choosing a license for your project, it is best to use one of the
  existing licenses--preferably one already in widespread
  use--rather than trying to create a new one.</p>

  <p>Creating a new license is a difficult legal process. It is
  likely that an existing license captures most, if not all, the
  concerns you might have, and the open-source community has little
  patience for people and organizations who don't believe in the
  already working, existing licenses. Moreover, a new license would
  perhaps need to be certified by the Open Source Initiative to
  satisfy the business objectives of its creator. Existing
  licenses--especially those in widespread use--are like brands in
  that people already are familiar with their terms and how to work
  with software licensed under them. By choosing a well-known,
  accepted license, you are also choosing a reduced learning and
  adoption curve for your community members.</p>

  <p>In this chapter we discuss what goes into a typical license
  and describe some of the most commonly used ones, including which
  type of projects they are best for. Which license is best for
  your project depends on your reasons for choosing to do
  open-source development. Chapter 7 includes a section on <a href=
  "IHE-62.html#32094">Choosing a License</a> that presents a list
  of questions to help you pick which license to use.</p>

  <p>Many people equate open source with the various open-source
  licenses, but the license is only a gate that people pass
  through. If people are not willing to agree to the terms of the
  license, then they don't pass through the gate. For those people
  who do accept, the license doesn't specify how they will work
  together; it merely defines some very basic ground rules.</p>

  <div id="what-a-license-does">
    <h2>What a License Does</h2>

    <p>A license grants outside developers certain rights that
    establish what they can and cannot do with the source code. The
    licenses we consider here grant the developer the right to use
    and modify the source code. Some licenses also include the
    right to use any intellectual property (IP), such as patents,
    that is embodied in the source code. Most licenses do not grant
    developers the right to take that IP and use it in a different
    application.</p>

    <p>Each license also requires developers to assume certain
    responsibilities. For example, some licenses require that any
    bug fixes that a developer makes to the source code must be
    contributed back to the original author. Another common
    requirement is that any IP used in the source code that a
    developer contributes must be made available (usually without
    fee) to other developers who use that code.</p>

    <p>A major area of variation among licenses is what, if
    anything, the developer must do in order to redistribute
    executable binaries built from modified versions of the source
    code. Many open-source licenses require that the modified
    source code also be made available, at no or nominal cost, to
    anyone who wants to see and use it--this being the whole point
    of open source. Some of the Sun-created licenses, SCSL and
    SISSL, include compatibility requirements in the license.</p>

    <p>Some licenses allow the source code to be incorporated into
    a <em>larger work</em> that is not subject to the terms of the
    license, although the original source code that is being
    included still is; other licenses consider any additions to be
    extensions of the original program and subject to all of the
    license terms. This is a key factor to consider if you plan on
    combining open-source code with proprietary code.</p>

    <p>Finally, all the licenses deal with various legal matters:
    warranty (typically none), liability (typically limited),
    termination of the license (if you violate any of its terms),
    dealing with brands and trademarks (typically not included with
    the license), and several other boilerplate issues that are
    also to be found in typical licenses accompanying commercial
    software (e.g., clauses about governing law, dispute
    resolution, U.S. government use, international use, and
    severability).</p>
  </div>

  <div id="what-a-license-does-not-do">
    <h2>What a License Does Not Do</h2>

    <p>It is just as important to realize what a license does not
    do. A license describes certain boundary conditions, but does
    not speak about how developers will actually work together. It
    is up to other documents or traditions to describe the process
    of contributing code, making a new release, and deciding what
    to do when disagreements arise. The next chapter looks at the
    day-to-day functioning of a typical open-source project and how
    to build up a community of users and developers.</p>

    <p>The license may not automatically apply to changes
    contributed by outside developers. Many open-source projects
    require people wishing to contribute code to first sign a
    contributor's agreement before their code is accepted. (This
    agreement is discussed later in the section <a href=
    "IHE-49.html#74978">Supplementing the License--Contributor
    Agreements</a>.)</p>

    <p>One other matter that most licenses do not touch on is how
    to ensure that modifications to the source code maintain
    compatibility with established standards. One way this can be
    done is to require that any distributed code pass a
    compatibility test in order to be granted the right to use a
    logo or brand. If there is an established brand, then this can
    be enough of a carrot for developers to keep things compatible.
    Most often, compatibility is maintained because the community
    values it and will not accept code contributions that deviate
    from the standard--anyone who wants to create an incompatible
    version is thus forced to fork the code and start a new
    project.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="more-on-copyright-...">
    <h2>More on Copyright ...</h2>

    <p>The author of a piece of software owns the copyright to the
    code and therefore the right to choose the terms of the
    license. The copyright owner may license the code to one group
    under one set of terms and to another group under a different
    set of terms. For example, the main product of the company
    Trolltech AS is the Qt library, a toolkit for building
    graphical user interfaces for applications. Trolltech makes the
    Qt library available under two very different licenses: the Q
    Public License (QPL) for use in noncommercial
    software<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"
    name="fnref2">2</a></sup> (used by the KDE open-source project
    in its work to build a graphical desktop for Linux) and the
    Professional License for companies wishing to build a
    commercial product using the Qt library. The QPL version is
    free. The Professional License version is a commercial product
    that must be purchased.</p>

    <p>Because the copyright holder determines the license terms,
    there can be a problem if there are multiple copyright owners.
    People who make changes or additions to the original source
    code become the copyright owners for the code they have
    written, even if it is just one line. When these changes are
    contributed back to the open-source project, their authors
    usually license them under the same terms as the original
    source code; indeed, many of the open-source licenses require
    this. Many open-source projects will not accept a contribution
    unless it is released under the same license as the original
    code--having various pieces of the source code under different,
    possibly incompatible, licenses would be too confusing and
    difficult.</p>

    <p>A further problem arises if a project decides that it wants
    to change the license being used. For example, the Mozilla
    project is in the process of changing from the MPL to a triple
    licensing of the source code under either MPL, GPL, or LGPL.
    However, to make this happen, every person who has contributed
    any source code, and hence owns the copyright to it, must agree
    to the change. Just tracking down all of the copyright holders
    can be a major task, let alone getting them to agree to the
    proposed licensing changes. Because of this, some open-source
    projects request, or even demand, that contributors also assign
    their copyright to either the original author of the code or
    some agreed-on third party, such as the Free Software
    Foundation.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="and-a-quick-word-on-patents">
    <h2>... And a Quick Word on Patents</h2>

    <p>Everything you know about patents from proprietary software
    development still applies to the world of open-source projects.
    Because your code is &quot;published&quot; when it is made
    available to people working on the project, any international
    patents required to implement the code need to be applied for
    beforehand and any U.S. patents need to be filed within 1 year.
    By contributing the source code to the project before a patent
    has been applied for, you may be giving up your right to patent
    the material, and by contributing it to the project without
    explicit license terms, you may be granting anyone who
    distributes a product based on the project the right to use
    your patent without compensation. Depending on the license you
    use, others may or may not have the right to use the source
    code, and the patent, in other work.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to make source code freely available,
    but require people to license your patents from you before they
    can distribute any software based on the source code. For
    example, the MPEG4IP project on SourceForge,<sup><a href="#fn3"
    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3" name="fnref3">3</a></sup>
    started by Cisco's Technology Center, provides an end-to-end
    system to explore MPEG-4 multimedia, but the codecs used by it
    are subject to patent royalties.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="the-licenses">
    <h2>The Licenses</h2>

    <p>As mentioned earlier, there are several dozen different
    open-source licenses in use today. Of these, only a few are in
    widespread use. A check of the world's largest open-source
    software development website, SourceForge,<sup><a href="#fn4"
    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4" name="fnref4">4</a></sup> in
    March 2004 showed that of the over 53,000 open-source projects
    hosted there that specified a license about 94% used one of
    only four basic types of licenses. By far the most popular
    choices are the GPL and the LGPL, used by almost 79% of the
    SourceForge projects. The Apache, BSD, and MIT family of
    licenses is next, accounting for over 10%. Just over 2% use the
    Artistic License. About 2% use the MPL, SPL, or CPL. The
    remaining 5% of the projects use three dozen other licenses. An
    almost identical breakdown of license use was found for the
    over 23,000 projects hosted on freshmeat,<sup><a href="#fn5"
    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5" name="fnref5">5</a></sup>
    another repository of open-source code.</p>

    <p>Before discussing the features and characteristics of these
    four types of open-source licenses, let us first look at some
    more-closed options based on proprietary licenses. These
    licenses allow varying amounts of collaboration but are not
    open source. We present the proprietary licenses first in order
    to show the progression from the licenses and contracts
    familiar to companies, to those common in open-source projects.
    The spectrum of licenses provides a spectrum of benefits,
    obligations, and opportunities for companies, and there really
    is no single perfect place on this spectrum for all projects.
    Each project has its own business requirements. Successful
    gated communities, for example, have been established and
    provided good value for companies, even though some open-source
    pundits have criticized them. Such criticism reflects the fact
    that, to some, open source is a political movement, while to
    others, it is primarily a business decision.</p>

    <p><em>Note:</em> This section is only an overview of the
    various licenses--for the real details you need to read the
    licenses themselves. The full text of each license discussed is
    included in Appendix B. Also please see the section
    <sup><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6" name=
    "fnref6">6</a></sup></p>
  </div>

  <div id="sun-community-source-license-scsl">
    <h2>Sun Community Source License (SCSL)</h2>

    <p>The Sun Community Source License (SCSL) was created by Sun
    in late 1998 in an attempt to combine the best of proprietary
    and open-source development. When the SCSL was written, many
    people at Sun were familiar with open source but were worried
    that releasing technologies such as Java under an open-source
    license would allow business competitors to hijack the
    technology by extending and embracing it--destroying any
    possibility of the goal to &quot;write once, run
    anywhere.&quot; Therefore, two major goals of the SCSL were
    that propriety modifications and extensions (including
    performance improvements) be allowed, but also that
    compatibility among deployed versions of the software be
    required and enforced through testing.</p>

    <p>Research Use basically allows you to do anything to the
    source code except give it to someone who has not also signed
    the SCSL. The only requirement is that any bug fixes be
    provided back to Sun.The SCSL defines two types of use:
    <em>Research</em> <em>Use</em> and <em>Commercial Use</em> .
    Research Use means that the source code is to be used only for
    research, development, educational, or personal use. Commercial
    Use is when an executable based on the source code is used or
    distributed for any direct or indirect commercial or strategic
    gain or advantage. (The original version of the SCSL also
    included a third type of use, <em>Internal Deployment Use</em>
    , which fell between Research and Commercial Use. In the most
    recent version of the SCSL, Internal Deployment has been merged
    with Commercial Use.)</p>

    <p>Commercial Use adds a requirement that any code that is
    distributed must pass a compatibility test as provided in the
    appropriate Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK). Commercial Use
    also requires that an organization must sign separate
    Commercial Use and trademark licenses. Because those licenses
    may include royalty payments, the SCSL does not meet the
    definition of an open-source license. The requirement that any
    distributed code must maintain compatibility has also caused
    some open-source leaders to reject the SCSL because they see
    this as limiting what developers can do with the source code.
    Of course, Sun never claimed that the SCSL was an open-source
    license--hence, the term <em>community source</em> .</p>

    <p>The SCSL grants the right to use any IP associated with the
    original source code and requires that a developer who
    contributes source code must also grant rights to any IP that
    it requires to other developers who wish to use that code.</p>

    <p>The SCSL was originally developed as a license for Jini, but
    was then modified to allow it to be used for providing
    developers access to Java. Because the needs of Java and Jini
    were different, the resulting common license became more
    complex. For example, to use the Java TCK requires signing a
    separate support agreement with Sun.</p>

    <p>The requirements of making the SCSL meet the needs for both
    Java and Jini, added to the sheer number of issues that the
    license must cover, resulted in a long and complicated license.
    Many developers and companies have found this confusing,
    causing some to refuse to sign the license. A revised version
    of the SCSL, made available in October 2000, while still
    complex, is somewhat clearer.</p>

    <p>Work on Java by many companies as part of the Java Community
    Process (JCP) uses the SCSL as the standard license for all
    reference implementations and TCKs developed. Although
    initially Sun was the original contributor for all the Java
    source code released, now other companies that lead development
    efforts for new Java APIs are the original contributors for
    those technologies--they are the ones licensing the new
    technology and specifying any possible royalties. As Java moves
    forward, Sun is becoming an equal player with no special
    privileges.</p>

    <p>The SCSL is intended for projects that are trying to develop
    an infrastructure technology, where compatibility and
    interoperability are crucial and where having a strong
    committed party guiding the development of the technology is
    seen as a positive factor. Organizations that sign the SCSL are
    in a second-class role compared to that of the original
    contributor, and that may limit the type and number of
    contributions they are willing to make to improve the licensed
    technology.</p>

    <p>For example, Jini was released under the SCSL in January
    1999 and has been successful in creating a large community of
    developers using and enhancing Jini. As of June 2004, there
    were over 200,000 developers who had downloaded the source
    code. Many of the companies working with Jini are very happy to
    let Sun take the lead on developing the core Jini technology
    while they devote their efforts to Jini-based products.
    However, they have also been reluctant to contribute
    enhancements they have made that would be useful to other Jini
    community members. In March 2005 Sun began relicensing the Jini
    source code under the Apache License, Version 2.0. This
    followed a community discussion, led by Sun's Jini team, on
    what license would be best.</p>

    <p>For a good overview of the ideas behind the SCSL, please see
    the paper &quot;Sun Community Source License Principles&quot;
    by Richard P. Gabriel and William N. Joy.<sup><a href="#fn7"
    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7" name="fnref7">7</a></sup> A

  </div>

  <div id="open-standardproprietary-code">
    <h2>Open Standard/Proprietary Code</h2>

    <p>Not a license per se, this model of collaboration is limited
    to the joint development of a public standard. Individual
    organizations then develop their own proprietary code to
    implement the agreed-on standards, which is pretty much
    business as usual but it may be all that is required to get the
    job done. Note that the use of <em>open</em> here means that
    the details of the standard are available for anyone to use or
    implement. It does not mean that the process that created the
    standard was open to anyone.</p>

    <p>An example of this is the public development of the ADA
    programming language, which was followed by several companies
    creating proprietary implementations of ADA compilers. Another
    example is the IEEE 754 floating-point standard, which was
    openly developed and then implemented in proprietary hardware
    by various chip manufacturers.</p>

    <p>Here the collaboration is the process of reaching agreement
    on what the standard should be. Once such a standard exists,
    proprietary efforts can compete to implement it.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="sun-industry-standards-source-license-sissl">
    <h2>Sun Industry Standards Source License (SISSL)</h2>

    <p>The Sun Industry Standards Source License (SISSL) is an
    open-source license for providing the source code to implement
    a specified standard, along with the right to use any IP
    associated with that source code. Developers can use and modify
    this source code and distribute executables built from it as
    they wish, but, if they make any modifications that do not
    comply with the standard, then they must publish the
    differences and make available a reference implementation under
    the same terms as the SISSL--forcing anyone attempting to use
    embrace-and-extend tactics to publicly document their changes.
    The SISSL is a true open-source license and has been certified
    as such by the Open Source Initiative.</p>

    <p>Larger works may be created under the SISSL, so it is
    possible to add proprietary code and not be required to publish
    it.</p>

    <p>The SISSL does not include any provisions for developers to
    voluntarily contribute source code back to the community. It is
    up to individual developers to choose a license under which
    they want to offer their modifications, if at all.</p>

    <p>Reasons to use the SISSL include developing momentum for a
    standard and preventing other companies from hijacking the
    standard with proprietary extensions. If the code is freely
    available, it is easier for developers to adopt the standard.
    If they then modify the code to be incompatible with the
    standard, the SISSL forces them to announce their changes and
    to publish the modified source code.</p>

    <p>Sun introduced the SISSL in February 2000 when it released
    the source code for a key component of the Network File System
    (NFS) protocol--the Transport Independent Remote Procedure Call
    protocol (TI-RPC). Since then, Sun has also used the SISSL for
    projects such as OpenOffice (actually under a dual license of
    SISSL and LGPL) and GridEngine.</p>

    <p>In September 2005 Sun announced that it was retiring the
    SISSL in support of the Open Source Initiative (OSI) attempts
    to minimize the number of open source licenses, so as to make
    the process of choosing a license easier for developers and
    companies.</p>

  <h2>Mozilla Public License (MPL), Sun Public License (SPL), IBM
  Common Public License (CPL), and Sun Common Development and
  Distribution License (CDDL)</h2>

    <p>The Mozilla Public License (MPL) was created by Netscape in
    early 1998 as it prepared to release the Netscape Communicator
    browser source code. Netscape wanted to allow companies to use
    the source code to create new proprietary larger works, but at
    the same time they wanted to ensure that modifications to the
    existing code would be contributed back to them and the rest of
    the community. No existing open-source license met those two
    goals, so they were forced to create a new license.</p>

    <p>The license they wrote was the Netscape Public License
    (NPL). Working in a true open-source manner, they posted a beta
    version of the license for public comment. They got plenty of
    feedback, and based on that they made a number of changes to
    the license and created a second license, the Mozilla Public
    License. The two licenses are identical, except that the NPL
    includes several clauses granting Netscape additional rights
    such as ownership of the Netscape brand and logo, the right to
    use code covered by the NPL in other Netscape products without
    those products falling under the NPL, the right to relicense
    code covered by the NPL to third parties under terms different
    from the NPL, and the right to include proprietary third-party
    code in the Netscape version of the browser. All of the source
    code released by Netscape on March 31, 1998, was initially
    under the NPL, whereas all new browser code created by Netscape
    was to be developed under the MPL. Moreover, all of the NPL
    code was scheduled to transition to the MPL within 2 years.</p>

    <p>The MPL explicitly grants the right to use any IP associated
    with the original source code and requires that when developers
    contribute source code they must also grant rights to any IP
    that it requires to other developers who wish to use that
    code.</p>

    <p>Larger works may be created using the MPL, so that it is
    possible to add proprietary code and not be required to publish
    it. Note that any changes to files in the original source code
    are considered modifications that must be made available to the
    community; they are not considered part of a larger work. This
    means that, although it is possible to add proprietary modules
    as part of a larger work, the interfaces in the original code
    to those modules must be made public.</p>

    <p>The Sun Public License (SPL) is practically identical to the
    Mozilla Public License (MPL). It merely changes all references
    to Mozilla to Sun and includes documentation as part of the
    source code. It is also a true open-source license. IBM's
    Common Public License (CPL) is similar but slightly
    shorter.</p>

    <p>In January 2005 Sun announced the Common Development and
    Distribution License (CDDL), created in partnership with
    members of the open source community and based upon the MPL.
    The CDDL is shorter, clearer, has simplified notice
    requirements, and contains strong protections against patent
    litigation. The CDDL was also created to be a reusable license
    that would be attractive to other open source efforts, so that
    other projects with similar community and licensing goals would
    not need to create a new license. Sun has used the CDDL for a
    number of its major open source projects such as
    OpenSolaris<sup><a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id=
    "fnref10" name="fnref10">10</a></sup> and Sun's Java System
    Application Server (the GlassFish project).<sup><a href="#fn11"
    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11" name=
    "fnref11">11</a></sup></p>

    <p>The reason to use the MPL is to create a community of
    developers who can easily share modifications but who might
    also want to make proprietary additions to go into products
    they would sell. For example, Sun released the source code for
    NetBeans (a Java IDE) under SPL, hoping to create an active
    community of developers working to improve it but allowing
    those same developers to sell any proprietary modules they
    develop.</p>

    <p>A copy of the latest version of the MPL can be found on the
    Mozilla website,<sup><a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id=

  <h2>GNU General Public License (GPL) and GNU Lesser General
  Public License (LGPL)</h2>

    <p>The license most associated with open source is the GNU
    General Public License (GPL). It was created by Richard
    Stallman for use by the Free Software Foundation to distribute
    the source code developed for the GNU project. An early version
    of the license was first used for GNU Emacs in 1985 and version
    1.0 of the GPL was published in February 1989. The philosophy
    behind the license is that, although organizations can sell
    computer software, the source code should be freely available
    for developers to learn from and to modify.</p>

    <p>Many people do not realize that the Free Software Foundation
    actually encourages people to charge as much as they wish or
    can to redistribute free software.<sup><a href="#fn16" class=
    "footnoteRef" id="fnref16" name="fnref16">16</a></sup> When
    Stallman speaks of <em>free software</em> , he is referring to
    freedom, not price. That is, this is <em>free</em> as in
    <em>free speech</em> , not <em>free beer</em> --a user is free
    to run the program, change the program, and redistribute the
    program with or without changes. The only stipulation on
    pricing that the GPL makes is that, when a copy of the source
    code is not distributed with the binaries, anyone who requests
    the source code can be charged only for the actual cost of
    making a copy. So it is possible to create or modify a piece of
    software licensed under the GPL and &quot;sell&quot; it for
    thousands of dollars, as long as the people who buy it are also
    given the source code on request. Of course, once they have the
    source code they in turn can redistribute it to anyone they
    choose, for whatever price they choose.</p>

    <p>The GPL does not allow larger works to be created from the
    open-source code base. The source code for any modifications or
    extensions must also be released under the GPL. This is the
    famous &quot;viral&quot; nature of the GPL. Developers who
    contribute code to a GPL project are assured that they will
    always be able to see the source code to any future extensions;
    no one will be able to take their code and use it in a
    proprietary product.</p>

    <p>Some people worry that if they were to include a GPLed
    program on a CD, that any other programs on the CD would become
    &quot;infected&quot; and they would need to make the source
    code for those other programs publicly available. This is not
    the case: The GPL explicitly states that bundling GPLed code
    with other programs has no effect on the other programs. It is
    only when source code released under the GPL is incorporated
    with other source code, compiled, and distributed that the
    other source code becomes subject to the GPL. All three steps
    are required for the GPL to take effect.</p>

    <p>If you use GPLed code in another program, but do not
    distribute that program, then there is no requirement for you
    to make your source code available. It is the act of
    distributing the binary executables that triggers the
    requirement to publish the source code. Individuals are welcome
    to modify GPLed code for their own use. When the GPL was
    written, this made sense because only the developer could use
    the resulting program if it was not distributed. With the
    growing number of programs that are used to support websites,
    this is no longer the case: Installing the program on a website
    can make it available to millions without actually distributing
    it. This is an area where the GPL may be modified in the
    future.</p>

    <p>The GPL ties access to the source code with the right to use
    any IP in the source code by insisting that any patent
    associated with contributed code &quot;must be licensed for
    everyone's free use or not licensed at all.&quot; If a company
    makes a contribution to a GPL project, it must allow any IP it
    owns that is in the donated code to be freely used by the
    members of the project. The GPL states that if a patent license
    does not permit royalty-free redistribution of the program by
    all those who receive copies of it, then no one can distribute
    it. This is &quot;to avoid the danger that redistributors of a
    free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in
    effect making the program proprietary.&quot;</p>

    <p>The Free Software Foundation has a second license, the GNU
    Lesser General Public License (LGPL), which is used for
    software libraries. Any modifications made to the source code
    for the library must be made available as with the GPL, but the
    source code for any program that is only linked with the
    library does not need to be made available. Thus, a proprietary
    program can use LGPLed libraries.</p>

    <p>The reason to use the GPL or LGPL is to make sure that any
    modifications to the original source code remain available and
    cannot be modified and then used privately in proprietary
    programs. HP licensed its e-speak technology using both types
    of license. The common core portions of e-speak were under GPL,
    so any changes must be shared with all; the libraries were
    under LGPL, so people could use them freely with proprietary
    code they wrote to create new e-services. Thus, HP assured that
    the basic technology was shared, but also encouraged developers
    to write code for new services.</p>

    <p>Some people and companies have complained that the GPL
    deprives them of their rights by forcing them to publish any
    changes they make to code that has been released under the GPL.
    This is a bogus argument based on major misconceptions about
    the ideas in the GPL. Instead of depriving people of rights,
    the GPL grants additional rights to those who choose to accept
    its conditions. Typically the source code for a proprietary
    product cannot be viewed, let alone modified or redistributed.
    The copyright on publicly available source code permits only
    reading--that is, all other rights are reserved to the
    copyright holder. The GPL offers developers a
    &quot;carrot&quot;: If they agree to make available their
    changes to the licensed software, they are then (and only then)
    permitted to modify and redistribute the code. No one is forced
    to accept the license, and anyone who accepts it is granted
    additional rights in exchange for sharing alike. Those who
    distort this by complaining about the GPL's limiting them are
    usually those most protective of their own proprietary work,
    which they would never even consider sharing.</p>

    Software Foundation website.<sup><a href="#fn17" class=

    also maintains a FAQ page<sup><a href="#fn18" class=

    answers many questions about the use of the GPL and LGPL.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="artistic-license">
    <h2>Artistic License</h2>

    <p>The Artistic License was created by Larry Wall in 1991 for
    Perl. An earlier version of Perl was released under the GPL,
    but Wall felt that the terms were too restrictive and wrote the
    Artistic License so that Perl could be used in commercial
    packages. The source code for Perl is currently available under
    either the GPL or the Artistic License.</p>

    <p>The Artistic License is quite different from the other
    open-source licenses in the number and scope of the
    alternatives it offers. Most licenses have very specific
    intents, for example to encourage or require people who make
    changes to the source to make those changes available to the
    original copyright holder and thereby to everyone. The Artistic
    License basically allows you to do anything you want as long as
    either you publish your changes to the source code along with a
    description of them or you rename your executables and document
    the differences--thus giving the original author artistic
    control over it.</p>

    <p>A copy of the Artistic License can be found on the Perl
    website.<sup><a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"

  <div id=
  "apache-berkeley-software-distribution-bsd-and-mit-licenses">
    <h2>Apache, Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), And MIT
    Licenses</h2>

    <p>A number of open-source licenses are variations on the
    license used by the original Berkeley Software Distribution
    (BSD) of Unix in June 1989, which is based on simple copyright.
    Essentially, every file has a copyright notice listing the
    original author and a requirement that any versions of the
    source code that are distributed include the original copyright
    notice. There is also a no-endorsement clause saying that the
    names of the originators and contributors cannot be used to
    endorse products derived from the source code. Finally, there
    is the usual disclaimer of any warranty.</p>

    <p>The original BSD license also included an advertising clause
    stating that any advertisements for derived products must
    include a statement saying the product was based on work done
    by the original contributor. This clause was removed from the
    BSD license in 1999, but still appears in licenses that were
    derived from the original BSD license.</p>

    <p>Variants of the BSD license, such as the one used by the
    Apache Software Foundation, add a clause saying that any
    derived products cannot use certain terms in the product name
    without prior permission. Products derived from the Apache
    source code cannot have the word <em>Apache</em> in their names
    unless they have permission from the Apache Software
    Foundation.</p>

    <p>The MIT License was written in 1987 for the release of the X
    Window System source code; it thus predates the BSD license.
    The two licenses are equivalent except for the BSD's
    no-endorsement clause. The MIT License is also sometimes called
    the X License, the MIT/X License, or the X Window System
    License.</p>

    <p>There are essentially no requirements on developers working
    with source code released under a BSD-style license. They can
    make any modifications they wish and redistribute the results
    however they choose. There are no incentives in the license to
    encourage developers to contribute their modifications back to
    the community.</p>

    <p>The BSD-style license does not include any mention of the
    right to use the IP in the source code. Just because a company
    has contributed source code under a BSD-style license does not
    mean that it has given up its rights to any IP it owns in the
    donated code. If developers donate code that includes IP they
    own, then they can require that anyone wishing to use their
    donation acquire a separate commercial license from them. Most
    open-source projects would reject such a donation. Likewise, if
    a company were to claim that some of the project's code
    infringed on one of its patents, then the response of the
    open-source project likely would be to remove the offending
    code and to rewrite it so that it no longer infringed.</p>

    <p>Note that in January 2004 the Apache Software Foundation
    made major changes to the Apache license that included a new
    requirement regarding patents. In the new 2.0 license, people
    making a contribution that includes patents they own must agree
    to grant a no-cost patent license to the project and its
    users.</p>

    <p>A copy of the BSD license can be found on the Open Source
    Initiative website.<sup><a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id=
    "fnref20" name="fnref20">20</a></sup> A copy of the Apache
    license can be found at the Apache Software Foundation
    website.<sup><a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"
    name="fnref21">21</a></sup> A copy of the X license is included
    with the latest release of the X Window System.<sup><a href=
    "#fn22" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref22" name=
    "fnref22">22</a></sup> The reason to use a BSD-style license is
    to make the source code as easily available as possible to
    outside developers, while possibly retaining the right to be
    credited for the original work. Sun's Project JXTA uses a
    variant of the Apache version 1.1 license.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="public-domain">
    <h2>Public Domain</h2>

    <p>Another choice is to use no license or copyright whatsoever
    and simply put source code into the public domain. From that
    point on, in theory, people can essentially do anything they
    like with the code. However, putting something into the public
    domain can be difficult because most countries of the world
    consider a work to be copyrighted automatically at the moment
    it is created--the author need not do anything special, such as
    registering the work or including a copyright notice in it. The
    U.S. copyright law was brought into agreement with this
    automatic copyright policy with the passing of the Berne
    Convention Implementation Act of 1988.<sup><a href="#fn23"
    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23" name=
    "fnref23">23</a></sup></p>

    <p>After the copyright expires the work enters the public
    domain. With today's long copyright terms, this can be a long
    wait--in the United States it is currently the author's
    lifetime plus 70 years. One exception to this is that the
    federal government cannot hold the copyright to any work it
    develops itself, so all government works enter the public
    domain immediately. This can also apply to works created by
    universities or companies that are funded by the government,
    depending on the contract terms.</p>

    <p>Some folks try to achieve the effect of placing a work in
    the public domain by including a copyright notice together with
    a statement saying that people are free to do anything they
    want with the code. This presents a possible liability issue
    for the original author, so it is prudent to also include a
    no-warranty clause, at which point you might as well use the
    basic BSD license.</p>

    <p>A work can be placed in the public domain by making a
    copyright-only dedication or public domain certification. This
    is an overt declaration that certifies that the declarer owns
    all copyrights in the work and is relinquishing all rights
    under copyright law. Such a dedication should be witnessed and
    recorded by a third party as evidence of the relinquishment.
    The Creative Commons offers such a service and dedication
    language at their website.<sup><a href="#fn24" class=
    "footnoteRef" id="fnref24" name="fnref24">24</a></sup></p>

    <p>You may want to make source code public domain if you had no
    plans for any further work on it. An example is end-of-life
    code that you are essentially dumping on the chance that it may
    be useful to someone, somewhere. Another example is sample code
    that you provide to help people get started using some
    technology.</p>

  <div id="dual-licensing">
    <h2>Dual Licensing</h2>

    <p>Ideally, any two open-source projects should be able to
    share their source code with each other. However, if the two
    projects use incompatible licenses, then this may not be
    possible. For example, code developed for the Linux operating
    system, which uses the GPL, cannot be used by the Apache web
    server project because the GPL specifies additional
    requirements that are incompatible with the Apache license. To
    avoid this problem, some open-source projects have chosen to
    make their source code available under a dual-licensing scheme
    that gives developers a choice as to which license they will be
    bound by.</p>

    <p>If there are two disjoint developer communities that cannot
    or will not use the same license, then a dual-licensing scheme
    to allow both communities to participate can make sense.
    However, both groups need to benefit. For companies that will
    not participate under GPL and developers who want to use the
    code with other GPLed code, only a dual license can bridge the
    gap. The Mozilla project started with code under a dual license
    of the Netscape Public License and the Mozilla Public License
    because Netscape needed to have special access to the code in
    its proprietary products. Use of the NPL was intended to
    diminish over time and indeed has done so. Now Mozilla is
    shifting to a triple license of MPL, GPL, and LGPL in order to
    work better with other open-source projects that use GPL.</p>

    <p>For OpenOffice, Sun has released the source code under a
    dual license that allows developers to choose to abide by
    either the LGPL or the rules of the SISSL. This allows
    companies that will not touch code under the LGPL to still be
    able to participate, even though the main community are the
    developers working under the LGPL.</p>

    <p>It is important that any code sent back to a dual-licensed
    project be contributed under the same dual-license structure.
    Individual developers can take the code, modify it, and
    redistribute it using only one of the licenses, but if they
    want to have their changes incorporated into the official
    source code then they must make them available under the same
    dual license that the project uses. Otherwise, the project
    would need to keep track of which contributions were made under
    which license and it would be impossible to combine them; in
    effect, the project would fork. In OpenOffice, for example, it
    is important to avoid having some code that can be used only by
    LGPL developers and other code only by SISSL developers.</p>

    <p>Dual licensing is also used by some companies to allow them
    to make money from their open-source work. They make the
    software they develop available under both an open-source
    license such as the GPL and a commercial license. Open-source
    developers can choose to use the open-source license, but any
    companies that wish to incorporate the code in a proprietary
    product must pay for it under the commercial license. This is
    the business model used by Trolltech AS for its Qt
    multiplatform application development framework and by both
    MySQL AB and Sleepycat Software for their database
    products.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="supplementing-the-license--contributor-agreements">
    <h2>Supplementing the License--Contributor Agreements</h2>

    <p>While the license specifies what rights someone has to use
    the source code, many open-source projects also require that
    developers wishing to contribute to the project sign an
    additional form. Developers must state that they have the right
    to contribute their source code--that is, that they own it and
    that it does not belong to someone else. If the developer works
    for a company, the form has the developer state that the
    company grants the right to use the contributed code to the
    project. Note that even developers doing open-source work on
    their own time might still need to get approval from their
    employers because employee agreements often specify that the
    company owns anything employees invent. This is discussed
    further in the section <a href="IHE-63.html#86271">Getting
    Approval as an Individual</a> in Chapter 7.</p>

    <p>The form also usually states that the developer grants to
    the project the right to freely use any patents and third-party
    IP used by the contributed code.</p>

    <p>Some projects use the form to assign the copyright of the
    code to the project. Other projects, such as OpenOffice, use a
    joint copyright assignment so that both the project and the
    contributor retain full rights to use, modify, and redistribute
    the copyrighted work.</p>

    <p>Developers usually need to sign the form only the first time
    they contribute code; the form then applies to any subsequent
    contributions. Note that requiring developers to sign such a
    form before accepting their contributions goes beyond the scope
    of the license. Developers are still free to exercise their
    rights to the code, but, if they want to participate with the
    specific project code base, they must sign the form. For
    example, to have a contribution included in the Sun-maintained
    OpenOffice project requires a joint copyright assignment. So
    far, several years after the start of the project, developers
    have been willing to go along with this. If the additional
    requirements of the contributor agreement form are not
    acceptable, then a developer may be motivated to join or create
    a new project, that is, to fork the project.</p>

    <p>The actual text of contributor agreements for several
    open-source projects can be found in Appendix C.</p>

    <p>Other project licenses, such as the VTK project license,
    state that by contributing to the project the outside
    developers give as a gift to the three copyright holders of VTK
    their contributed code and intellectual property. This is an
    implicit contributor agreement.</p>

    <p>An open-source project consists of more than just the source
    code. There is also associated documentation. Some of this is
    internal documentation used only by the project's developers
    that can be covered by the same licensing as the code it
    describes. Other documentation, however, such as user guides,
    tutorials, and reference manuals that are intended for
    widespread distribution, have different licensing needs than
    the source code, especially if they will be published as
    books.</p>

    <p>The point of using an open-source model for documentation is
    both to make it freely available to as many people as possible
    and to make it as good and up-to-date as possible by having
    many people write and review it. Both the freedom to distribute
    a document and the freedom to modify it are essential. Note
    that there are many documents that can be freely downloaded for
    personal use but that are protected by copyright and cannot be
    modified except by the original authors.</p>

    <p>Documentation is different from source code in many
    important ways. Although both can be downloaded for online use,
    people often want the convenience of a printed version of
    documentation, and a commercially published book is usually of
    better quality than a copy you print for yourself. There are
    major costs involved in writing and publishing a book, so
    potential authors and publishers have concerns about how many
    people will actually buy the book--as opposed to reading it
    online or printing their own copy--and also about other
    publishers reprinting the book and selling it. Any
    documentation license needs to address these concerns. Note
    that whereas code is usually developed to solve a problem for
    its writer (&quot;scratch your own itch&quot;), books are
    written mainly to earn money for the author and to solve the
    readers' problems.</p>

    <p>There is also the question of the author's reputation. When
    you read a book, you directly experience the author's words.
    This is unlike software, where a user never sees the source
    code, only the effect of running it. Often a book has a single
    author, and if there are problems because the text has errors
    or is difficult to read, then the reader will rightly blame the
    author. Likewise, the reader will give the author credit for
    clear writing and good information. If anyone can modify the
    text and distribute a new version, then the author might be
    blamed for errors someone else introduced, and the author's
    reputation could suffer. So making sure that any third-party
    modifications are clearly marked as such may be important to
    the author.</p>

    <p>Documentation licenses need to specify whether commercial
    redistribution is permitted, what types of modifications are
    allowed and how they are to be identified, whether translations
    are allowed, whether the source text must be made available
    (and, if so, whether it must be in a nonproprietary format),
    and how to credit the original author and publisher. Like
    source licenses, documentation licenses usually specify that
    there is no warranty and that aggregation with other documents
    doesn't cause the license to apply to them.</p>

    <p>Some licenses mention good practices for showing common
    courtesy to authors, such as contacting the authors well before
    redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a
    chance to provide an updated version of the document, and
    offering them a free copy of any published book or CD-ROM.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="open-publication-license">
    <h2>Open Publication License</h2>

    <p>One commonly used license is the Open Publication License, a
    cooperative effort of O'Reilly Publishing, New Riders
    Publishing, the Open Source Initiative, the OpenContent
    Project, VA Research, and others, written in 1999. The license
    was designed to be friendly to commercial publishers, such as
    O'Reilly and New Riders, who have published several books using
    the license--the full text of many of these books is available
    on the publisher's website.</p>

    <p>The license is fairly short. It allows for commercial
    redistribution and modifications, provided that any
    modifications are identified and dated, that the original
    author and publisher are acknowledged, that the location of the
    original unmodified document be identified, and that the
    original authors' names not be used to endorse the new work
    without permission.</p>

    <p>The license has two options that can be specified to
    prohibit the distribution of substantively modified versions
    without the explicit permission of the author and to prohibit
    any publication in book form for commercial purposes unless
    prior permission has been obtained from the copyright
    holder.</p>

    <p>Note that an earlier, related license, the Open Content
    License, is often casually referred to as the &quot;OPL.&quot;
    So if you see a reference to the OPL you will need to check to
    see which license it really indicates.</p>

    <p>A copy of the Open Publication License can be found on the
    OpenContent website.<sup><a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef"

  </div>

  <div id="gnu-free-documentation-license-fdl">
    <h2>GNU Free Documentation License (FDL)</h2>

    <p>The GNU Free Documentation License (FDL) is similar to the
    Open Publication License (with neither option specified), but
    it specifies everything in much greater detail. The FDL was
    written in early 2000. It is used by many open-source projects
    where the source code uses the GPL, such as the GNOME project.
    A number of books using the FDL have been published
    commercially.</p>

    <p>The FDL distinguishes between the main technical content of
    a document and <em>secondary sections</em> that focus on the
    publisher or author, such as a preface or acknowledgments.
    These secondary sections can be declared invariant and required
    to be included in any derived works. Each author can also
    specify material that must be included on the front or back
    covers of any derived works.</p>

    <p>People making modifications must add a history section to
    document their changes. A machine-readable copy of the
    document, in an accessible (that is, nonproprietary) format,
    must be made freely available.</p>

    <p>The FDL does not include any warranty or liability
    disclaimers.</p>

    <p>A copy of the GNU FDL can be found on the Free Software
    Foundation website.<sup><a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id=
    "fnref26" name="fnref26">26</a></sup></p>

  <div id="public-documentation-license-pdl">
    <h2>Public Documentation License (PDL)</h2>

    <p>The Sun Public Documentation License (PDL) is a revision of
    the Mozilla Public License modified to apply to documentation.
    It was first used in August 2002 as the license for OpenOffice
    documentation. It was designed to facilitate revisions to
    existing documents, requiring that all modifications be
    documented, but not going into the detail that the FDL
    requires. It also makes it possible to take pieces from one
    document and use them in another, provided that reasonable
    attribution is provided.</p>

    <p>A copy of the PDL can be found on the OpenOffice
    website.<sup><a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"

  <div id="freebsd-documentation-license">
    <h2>FreeBSD Documentation License</h2>

    <p>The FreeBSD Documentation License is just like the BSD
    license: It allows people to do anything they want with the
    licensed material as long as they retain the original copyright
    and disclaimers.</p>

    <p>A copy of the FreeBSD Documentation License can be found on
    the FreeBSD website.<sup><a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef"

  <div id="creative-commons">
    <h2>Creative Commons</h2>

    <p>The Creative Commons<sup><a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef"
    id="fnref29" name="fnref29">29</a></sup> is an organization
    &quot;devoted to expanding the range of creative work available
    for others to build upon and share.&quot; It provides a set of
    licenses aimed primarily at artists, musicians, photographers,
    and writers that permits a variety of rights to consumers of
    the work, such as the right to create, distribute, and perform
    derivative works. These licenses can be used for documentation
    and, perhaps with some modifications made in conjunction with
    the Creative Commons, for software source code.</p>

    <p>The Creative Commons in many ways exemplifies the principles
    and core values of the open-source community. Its website is a
    good place to visit to get a feel for how an even balance
    between the rights of the author and the rights of others can
    optimize opportunities for innovation.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="licenses-1">
    <h2>Licenses</h2>

    <p>Open source is more than just a license and source code in a
    public place. The success of an open-source project is
    influenced mainly by how day-to-day matters are handled, not by
    the choice of license. Open source requires community, culture,
    shared vision, and a commitment to continuous design. That a
    project like Apache can succeed based on a minimal BSD-style
    license that does not even mention collaboration is proof that
    we need to look beyond the license. But the choice of a license
    can help set the tone for the project and define its legal
    boundaries. The license you choose also can determine how code
    from different contributors can be combined and which are the
    natural projects for you to collaborate with.</p>

    <p>None of the advice in this chapter should be taken as legal
    advice. For the definitive meanings of the licenses described
    here or for help in drafting your own, please engage a
    lawyer.</p>
