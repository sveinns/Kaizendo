  <h1>6. How To Do Open-Source Development</h1>

  <p>There is no one correct way to run an open-source project.
  Successful open-source projects can be quite different from each
  other. Some, such as Apache, are very democratic and volunteers
  are welcome to participate in all activities. Others, such as
  MySQL, where almost all of the developers work for one company,
  primarily do their development internally and then release the
  results; users and developers engage with each other to report
  bugs, request new features, and generally discuss the software,
  but development happens less visibly. There are even some
  projects that do not have a community at all, but consist of just
  a web page where new versions are made available for people to
  download, and perhaps an email address where comments can be
  sent.</p>

  <p>The more a project encourages conversations and interactions
  among all of its community members, the more benefits it will get
  from using open-source. The key point about open source is that
  the development process must really be open: All the developers,
  both internal and external, need to have the same access to the
  source code and be able to fully participate in discussions and
  decisions about its design. If you currently have a
  geographically dispersed workgroup, then you are already probably
  aware of many of the issues involved. More traditional,
  collocated workgroups will probably need to change the way they
  currently work.</p>

  <p>In this chapter we look at the major activities needed to do
  an open-source project and also discuss the process of creating a
  new release. As we do so, note the new jobs that need to be done.
  To have a successful open-source project requires that there be
  people to do those jobs, so you will need additional resources.
  We also discuss participating in an existing open-source project
  and using an open-source-like process, corporate source, within
  your company.</p>

  <p>One other important point to keep in mind as you read on is
  that although most of the focus in this section is on developers,
  users are also a big part of the process. It is important to keep
  users involved in the process and not treat them as second-class
  citizens.</p>

  <div id="the-infrastructure-needed-for-an-open-source-project">
    <h2>The Infrastructure Needed for an Open-Source Project</h2>

    <p>Every open-source project provides a public code archive to
    access the source code, documentation on both how to use and
    how to modify the code, mailing lists and newsgroups to discuss
    issues, a database to record bugs, and a website to provide
    access to the preceding facilities. These core features are the
    skeleton on which a healthy open-source project is built.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="public-code-archive">
    <h2>Public Code Archive</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>A prime requirement for an open-source project is that
      the source code be publicly available.</li>

      <li>Any developer, whether inside or outside the company,
      should be able to get the latest version of the code
      anytime.</li>

      <li>A developer who is in charge of maintaining a module--the
      <em>module owner</em> --should be able to make changes
      directly to the source code.</li>

      <li>Contributions and bug fixes from developers who have not
      yet been granted write-access to the source code need to be
      integrated into the source code archive in a timely manner.
      This can be a major task and will most likely be done by the
      various module owners and other core developers.</li>

      <li>Builds of the source code must be done frequently (daily
      where possible) and made available for download by developers
      and users. Usually a less recent build that was fairly stable
      is also kept available for download. Users should always be
      able to download a working version of the code.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is very different from the usual proprietary
    development model where the internal developers have their own
    private copy of the official source code that they periodically
    release to external developers. With everyone sharing the same
    source code archive, when any developer fixes a bug or makes a
    change, it is immediately available to all of the other
    developers; internal developers do not get special access. You
    do not want to discourage potential contributors by having them
    spend time tracking down a bug and fixing it, only to find that
    someone else has already done so.</p>

    <p>Most open-source projects use CVS (Concurrent Versioning
    System) to maintain the repository of shared code. CVS provides
    a way for multiple developers to edit the source code without
    stepping on each other's changes. It also supports defining
    branches to create multiple versions of the code and makes it
    possible to roll back to an earlier version. CVS is itself an
    open-source project and is available for free.<sup><a href=
    "#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1" name=
    "fnref1">1</a></sup></p>

    <p>Whatever source control management (SCM) system your project
    uses, it is important that it be freely available to your
    project's developers. Someone working part-time on your project
    will not be willing to spend lots of money to purchase a
    proprietary SCM. Your current development team members may
    believe that whatever proprietary SCM your company uses is
    superior to CVS and that they will have to give up useful
    features if they are forced to switch. They need to understand
    that it is important that everyone uses the same SCM system and
    that the features they lose by using CVS will be made up in
    other ways by working with outside developers. It is hoped that
    the missing features will eventually be added either to CVS or
    to its replacement, Subversion. The Subversion
    project<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"
    name="fnref2">2</a></sup> is working to build a version control
    system that will be a compelling replacement for CVS in the
    open-source community.</p>

    <p>Bonsai<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"
    name="fnref3">3</a></sup> is a tool used by the Mozilla project
    that lets developers perform queries on the contents of a CVS
    archive to determine recent changes and who was responsible for
    changing a particular line of code.</p>

    <p>One job that must be assigned to a team member is to set up
    and maintain the CVS code server. A second job is to do the
    daily build and make sure it works--and if it doesn't, to find
    out why and to communicate the problem to the relevant
    developers. A third job, already mentioned, is to integrate bug
    fixes and contributions into the source code archive.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="project-documentation">
    <h2>Project Documentation</h2>

    <p>In addition to the normal end-user documentation required
    for any software product, an open-source project needs to have
    good internal documentation for developers. You want to make it
    as easy as possible for new developers to learn their way
    around the source code. The easier it is to learn enough to get
    started, the more developers you'll attract. Conversely, if the
    internal documentation is poor or nonexistent, many potential
    developers will become frustrated and give up.</p>

    <p>Those developers who are working on the project as part of
    their normal day job will be prepared to devote whatever time
    is needed to come up to speed on how the code is organized and
    how it works. For them, poor documentation is just business as
    usual, but for people with only a few hours of free time in
    their off-hours who just want to fix an annoying bug or make a
    minor enhancement, the quality of the documentation can make
    the difference between success and failure. Initially new
    developers need to be able to locate the relevant locations in
    the source code and learn enough about how that code works to
    be able to modify it. If they are successful, then they are
    likely to do more work on the code. One web-based tool that can
    help developers search the source code is lxr, the Linux
    Cross-Reference tool.<sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef"
    id="fnref4" name="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>

    <p>This means that all developers who contribute to the source
    code need to be encouraged to document their code. Someone also
    needs to write design documents and keep them
    up-to-date--especially needed is a high-level description of
    the software architecture. This could be an additional job for
    any technical writers that are available on your project.
    Mailing-list archives are also a good place for new (and old)
    developers to learn about various design decisions.</p>

    <p>Another important document is a <em>project road map</em>
    that describes the current development plans for the overall
    project and the individual modules. The road map reflects what
    the core developers and module owners plan to work on based on
    discussions on the community mailing lists. The road map allows
    developers and users to get a sense of what changes they can
    expect and when they might happen. They can join in the
    official work then or, if their particular needs are for other
    changes, they know that they need to organize additional
    efforts. Many developers decide what they will work on by
    consulting the project road map, so it is vital that the road
    map be kept current. The road map, and the community
    discussions about what features are part of it, helps to focus
    your project and give it direction.</p>

    <p>You will also want to create wish lists for the overall
    project and for each individual module. The wish lists are a
    good place for developers to look when they want to find
    something interesting to do that will help the project. The
    process of creating the wish list encourages users to speak up
    and participate in the design. Involving users as designers is
    essential if the project is to be really successful.</p>

    <p>Your users will also need documentation. It is likely that
    some of them will be willing to help write it. The public user
    mailing list is an excellent source of information; organizing
    information in it into a list of frequently asked questions
    (FAQ) is a good first step.</p>

    <p>If you have professional technical writers working on your
    project, they will probably be the module owners for the
    documentation. Just as with code, others can send them
    suggestions and corrections, but they are the ones who decide
    what goes into the documentation. Of course, as with a code
    module, a volunteer who makes a number of good suggestions can
    earn the right to edit a document directly.</p>

    <p>Be sure that the documentation you provide is in a format
    that people can easily read such as plain text or HTML. Don't
    require that your users and developers have special software to
    read the documentation--especially software they need to pay
    for! This rule also applies to the software needed to create
    the documentation. A number of open-source projects have
    discussed standardizing on DocBook/XML as the canonical format
    for open-source documentation.<sup><a href="#fn5" class=
    "footnoteRef" id="fnref5" name="fnref5">5</a></sup></p>
  </div>

  <div id="bug-database">
    <h2>Bug Database</h2>

    <p>Bugs happen. Being able to keep track of outstanding bugs is
    a must. The bug-tracking tool you choose should be as easy as
    possible for developers to use; otherwise they may not. Some
    developers prefer a bug tool that they can use via email so
    that bug reports are mailed to them and they can reply via
    email. Other developers prefer a web-based bug database.</p>

    <p>Because users are a prime source of bug reports, it should
    to be easy for them to report bugs. Keep in mind that they have
    already suffered by discovering bugs--they may have lost their
    work and undoubtedly lost time--so don't make it painful for
    them to submit bug reports too. It makes sense to have a
    special, easy way for users to report bugs, different from the
    one developers use--it may be necessary for someone in the
    project to then check whether the bug has already been reported
    and, if not, to add it the bug database. Also, the more
    encouragement you can give to users to report bugs well, the
    more testers you will effectively have.</p>

    <p>Another good practice is to have a developer who is
    responsible for reading the user mailing list and filing bug
    reports for problems reported there. It may make sense to have
    a separate mailing list just for bug reports.</p>

    <p>The bug database may also be a good place to keep track of
    suggested enhancements. Any developer should be able to record
    an idea for a future improvement. Module owners should make
    sure that good ideas that come up in the mailing list are also
    recorded. Periodically, the suggestions recorded in the bug
    database should be used to update the wish lists for the
    overall project and for the individual modules.</p>

    <p>An example of a bug-tracking system used by various
    open-source projects is Bugzilla.<sup><a href="#fn6" class=
    "footnoteRef" id="fnref6" name="fnref6">6</a></sup> It was
    originally created for the Mozilla project and the source code
    for it is freely available. The NetBeans open-source project is
    currently using Issuezilla, which is based on Bugzilla. Another
    open-source bug system being developed is Scarab.<sup><a href=
    "#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7" name=
    "fnref7">7</a></sup> The work to maintain the bug database is
    another infrastructure job.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="open-mailing-lists-or-newsgroups">
    <h2>Open Mailing Lists or Newsgroups</h2>

    <p>It is important that all the discussion about an open-source
    project be done in the open. All the users and developers
    should be using a public mailing list or newsgroup for their
    discussions. These discussions include announcements, bug
    reporting, problems and how to solve them, design issues, and
    proposals for future work. Your internal developers should also
    be participating there and not just using internal mailing
    lists. <em>Note:</em> For brevity's sake, in the following
    discussion, when we talk about using a public mailing list we
    also include using a public newsgroup or a web-based discussion
    forum.</p>

    <div id="let-everyone-know-what-is-happening">
      <h3>Let Everyone Know What is Happening</h3>

      <p>It is vital that community members be involved in
      discussions with your internal developers. If it appears that
      your internal developers are doing their work in closed
      internal meetings and exchanges of private email, then
      outside developers will feel like they are being treated as
      second-class citizens and will not participate as much as
      they might. This is not to say that your internal developers
      must communicate only through public email lists or
      newsgroups, but when you have a meeting be sure to post notes
      from it to the list and consider inviting outside developers
      to attend the meeting, either in person or over the phone.
      Also, if you post the agenda beforehand, outside developers
      can express their viewpoints via email and these views can be
      considered at the meeting. Note that the more design work
      done via email, the easier it is to preserve it in a mailing
      list archive; often design decisions are never documented and
      this can create problems down the road when the assumptions
      underlying the design change or new people join the project
      and need to understand why certain decisions were made the
      way they were.</p>

      <p>There are other reasons to let everyone know what is being
      considered. It is important to alert the community about any
      plans to make major changes to the code. The worst situation
      is when a module owner makes large changes to a module with
      no notification whatsoever. If other developers find out
      about the change because it breaks something they are working
      on or because when they go to do something with the module
      they find the code totally different, then they are not going
      to be happy. They are going to feel that they cannot depend
      on that module, because to them it has changed in an
      arbitrary manner. It is slightly better if the module owner
      announces that the code has been changed; the other
      developers may be just as bad off, but at least they know why
      sooner. The best thing to do is to announce in advance which
      changes are being considered, engage in open discussion with
      anyone concerned, and then announce what has been changed
      when the new code is checked in. Outside developers will feel
      they are part of the process because they really are part of
      it--plus the quality of the design will likely be improved
      because the discussions included more viewpoints.</p>

      <p>On an Apache project mailing list in July 2000 there was a
      heated exchange of messages caused by private discussions.
      Two groups, one from Sun and the other from IBM, had each
      been discussing a particular major component primarily among
      themselves instead of using the public email list. When one
      group announced a new project to redo the component's
      architecture, the other--which had been developing that
      component--basically said &quot;Hey, who are you to tell us
      what to do? That's our code and we'll take care of it
      ourselves, thank you very much.&quot; Lots of flames then
      flooded the mailing list. This case eventually had a
      satisfactory resolution, but the upset never needed to
      happen. It turns out that the group members who were
      originally developing the component had concluded in their
      private discussion that it should be redesigned, but that
      they didn't have the manpower internally to do so. Had they
      posted their discussion, they would have gotten lots of
      volunteers and retained their leadership position. Meanwhile,
      the other group of developers had privately discussed their
      problems with the current design, but didn't make them public
      until they announced the new project. Had they posted their
      comments earlier, everyone would have come out for a
      redesign, and they wouldn't have created a rift with the
      original development group.<sup><a href="#fn8" class=
      "footnoteRef" id="fnref8" name="fnref8">8</a></sup></p>
    </div>

    <div id="posting-etiquette">
      <h3>Posting Etiquette</h3>

      <p>In general, your internal developers have to be more
      careful about what they post than random, outside developers
      do. Even though they may think they are speaking as
      individuals, everyone else will take what they say as your
      company's official policy. If an internal developer flames
      someone, it will not be seen as the action of an individual
      but rather as the action of &quot;one of those arrogant
      guys&quot; at your company. However, it is really important
      that your developers do participate, so you need to encourage
      them to do so. Some folks will never trust your company, but
      they may trust Ken, Yarda, and Stefan--employees of your
      company that the community comes to know as individuals.</p>

      <p>As a rule, when sending a reply to a public mailing list
      or newsgroup remember that it will be read by everyone, taken
      out of context, and viewed suspiciously by folks trying to
      determine what your company is up to now. If you have a
      strong emotional feeling when writing the message, it might
      be best not to send it right away; instead, wait a day and
      see how it looks then. Often the first draft will let you get
      any angry feelings out of your system, and the second draft
      is the one that you should actually send.</p>

      <p>One final point about messages: Don't be defensive. If
      someone attacks your company's actions, it is much better to
      wait a bit and see if, as often happens, another outsider
      will come to your company's defense. This will carry more
      weight than if the same message came from an employee of your
      company. Of course, if the original message points out an
      actual mistake that you have made, the sooner you admit that
      it is a mistake and explain how you plan to correct it, the
      better.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="types-and-number-of-mailing-listsnewsgroups">
      <h3>Types and Number of Mailing Lists/Newsgroups</h3>

      <p>Different mailing lists or newsgroups can be used for
      different purposes. A special moderated list for major
      announcements that receives only infrequent posts will be
      subscribed to by many users and developers. An unmoderated
      list with frequent postings on technical issues will have a
      smaller audience. In general, it is better to have too few
      mailing lists than to have too many.</p>

      <p>Which would you prefer: to arrive at a party where the
      first room you see is comfortably filled with people talking
      animatedly, where the host greets you and starts
      introductions, and where groups move into nearby rooms when
      appropriate; or to arrive at a party where some rooms have
      only one or two people doing and saying nothing while the
      rest are empty? Following this analogy, you should strive to
      make your email lists like parties, each with a comfortable
      number of active conversations and an attentive host. To
      start this off, you should try to create one email list that
      is alive with activity, creating new lists only as needed. A
      host has an important job that must be done well because it
      helps set the tone for the community. Part of the host's job
      is to actively discourage flaming in order to make the list a
      safe place for people to post to.</p>

      <p>A small project may need only a single mailing list for
      all project-related discussions. For a large, active project,
      each module might have several mailing lists. When the number
      of messages sent out each day grows too large, the people on
      the list might call for splitting it into several lists.
      Before you do so, make sure that it's not just a temporary
      increase in traffic. A single thread that lots of folks chime
      in on can easily double the message rate.</p>

      <p>You will need a mailing list for users. Free software
      generally does not have a customer support hotline that users
      can call when they have a problem. They need a mailing list
      or newsgroup where they can post their questions. Developers
      or other users can then post replies to help them out.</p>

      <p>It is important to keep an archive of each list. This is
      useful for new developers or new users so they can see if a
      particular issue has already been discussed. It's also useful
      as a group memory. Be sure to make searching the archives
      easy.</p>

      <p>In order to encourage people to answer other folks'
      questions, the Jini team had a policy of waiting 2 days
      before answering a general question. (Those that could be
      answered only by the core team, mostly &quot;why was this
      done?&quot; questions, were answered immediately.) This
      worked very well and has resulted in a mailing list where
      community members naturally answer most posted questions,
      with the core developers answering only the more difficult,
      technical ones.</p>

      <p>Mailing lists and archives serve another purpose:
      dispelling suspicions of an insider cabal. The health of any
      community is likely to become poisoned when its members
      believe that there is a group of people who are secretly
      making the important decisions. This suspicion can sap the
      morale of any organization, and it can happen even if it is
      well known and expected that decisions take place behind
      closed doors.</p>

      <p>In an open-source project, the developers may feel that
      their efforts are being exploited when the project does not
      seem to embrace transparency. One of the best and easiest
      ways to avoid this potential problem is to have an archived
      mailing list (or lists) that has a clear influence on
      decision making.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="spam-concerns">
      <h3>Spam Concerns</h3>

      <p>With the continuing increase in the amount of unsolicited
      and unwanted email messages (spam) that flood the Internet,
      you want to do everything you can to keep spam from appearing
      on your project's mailing lists. If only a few spam messages
      make it through to your mailing lists, it's just a minor
      inconvenience--but if a large proportion of the messages are
      spam, then the mailing lists can become useless.</p>

      <p>There are two types of spam to worry about in open-source
      projects: conventional spam which is typically advertising
      sent in bulk and spam email sent by project members but
      inappropriate for the list. An example of the second type of
      spam is a flame war on a topic unrelated to the project.
      Sometimes this can happen when politics or world events are
      mentioned.</p>

      <p>Each project will have a slightly different definition of
      which messages are really spam. Is it okay for a company to
      post a product announcement that relates to the project? What
      about job offers? What about posting the same message to
      several of the project's mailing lists? What about continuing
      to argue after a decision has already been made? What about a
      humorous political cartoon?</p>

      <p>Some open-source projects install spam filters to stop
      conventional spam from infecting their mailing lists. Others
      avoid conventional spam by restricting posts only to
      subscribers. Some allow anyone to post, but if the sender is
      not on an approved list then the message is first sent to a
      moderator. If the moderator confirms that it is a valid
      message, then it is forwarded on to the mailing list and the
      sender is added to the approved list. Sometimes messages can
      be delayed due to the need for moderation because it can take
      hours or even days before the moderator gets around to
      approving the message. Having several moderators located in
      different time zones around the globe can help.</p>

      <p>For inappropriate messages, a moderator or other community
      leader can send a private note to the sender suggesting
      either that the email is not appropriate or that the email
      should be sent to individuals rather than to the whole list.
      For companies or individuals advertising related products or
      talking about possible jobs, a moderator or community leader
      should determine how appropriate the message is and either
      notify the sender if it's obviously out of line or bring it
      up with the community if it is a close call.</p>

      <p>Whatever spam policy you decide on, be sure to make it
      clear to everyone. People need to have confidence that the
      mailing list software works well. It's generally better that
      a few spams make it through to the list than that legitimate
      messages be classified as spam and dropped. What constitutes
      spam depends on the culture of the community. A savvy
      community designer will post guidelines on the community
      website.</p>

    <p>In addition to mailing lists, each project needs a website
    where potential users and developers can find out about the
    project and where news about the project can be posted. The
    website should be the portal to all aspects of the project. The
    site can have user guides, tutorials, archives of the mailing
    lists, and other documentation. And of course there should be a
    download page where folks can obtain the latest version of both
    the source code and ready-to-use binaries. There may also be
    pointers to web pages for commercial products associated with
    the project, although the main site should not have a strong
    commercial feel to it.</p>

    <p>When people first hear of your project, the project's
    website is where they will go to find out about it. The website
    will help set their expectations about your project: What is
    the current project status? How can they download executables
    or source code? Does it seem professional? Are new developers
    welcomed? Is it a real community where they can fully
    participate, or is it more like a user group where their
    participation is limited? Is it an active effort or does it
    look dead? Why should they get involved? Is there help or
    tutorials available for beginners? Their experience of your
    project through the website will dictate whether they want to
    get involved as either users or developers, or whether they
    just leave.</p>

    <p>For a small project, the website might be just a few pages.
    For a large project, the site might be quite large, with each
    module having its own set of pages. Maintaining the website and
    making sure the content on it is kept current is another
    infrastructure job that must have a person assigned to it. For
    large projects, an additional person is needed to be the
    editor-in-chief.</p>

    <p>We say more about the project website in the section on
    creating a community of developers.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="software-life-cycle">
    <h2>Software Life Cycle</h2>

    <p>We've looked at some of the infrastructure that supports an
    open-source project. Now let's look at some of the activities
    that need to happen as the project progresses.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="planning-and-decision-making">
    <h2>Planning And Decision Making</h2>

    <p>All of the planning and decision making for an open-source
    project should take place either on the project's public
    mailing lists or at public community meetings. Small groups
    can, and should, get together in private to work up proposals
    and suggestions, but as soon as possible these need to be
    opened for community feedback.</p>

    <p>Public discussion generally takes longer to make a decision
    than a proprietary development group does, but because the
    diversity of the viewpoints is greater for an open-source
    effort the resulting decision is likely to be of higher
    quality. This can translate into a shorter overall development
    cycle, because subsequent work will probably not need to be
    discarded because the <em>real</em> issues came up after,
    rather than during, the discussion period.</p>

    <p>In an open-source project without explicit discussion
    cut-offs, the discussion can sometimes go on for a long time
    with diminishing benefit. In many of these cases, it is
    relatively clear what the sense of the decision is, but unless
    the discussion is cut off at the right time, the community will
    not seem crisp and well run. Therefore, it is crucial that
    someone be sensitive to when the discussion seems to be winding
    down. At that point, it is important to post a wrap-up message
    that summarizes the main issues and the consensus on what
    should be done. Part of the wrap-up is to list who has
    volunteered to actually do the work. Often the person who has
    initiated the discussion is the one to wrap things up, but some
    developers--especially those used to working in a hierarchical
    company--will expect someone else to make a decision and tell
    them what to do, which is not the way open-source works.</p>

    <p>One of the most common reasons that a software project fails
    is because it does not meet the needs of its intended audience.
    This is much less likely to occur if the actual users of the
    project can join in the discussions where the project's
    functionality is being defined. For a really successful
    open-source project, it is probably the users that started this
    discussion in the first place. Only after the need has been
    clearly articulated and possible solutions have been debated
    can the developers work on a plan to implement a solution. If
    there are several proposed solutions, then the developers may
    choose to experiment by implementing trial versions of each, so
    that the users can try them all out to decide which is the
    best. Note that this process is called user-centered design or
    evolutionary design and is too seldom practiced by proprietary
    projects; the open-source process naturally encourages a
    user-centered approach.</p>

    <p>Design decisions, and the rationale behind them, need to be
    recorded in the project's design documents. There should be a
    person assigned to keep them up to date. Scheduling decisions
    should be recorded in a project road map document. As already
    mentioned, the road map allows developers and users to get a
    sense of what changes they can expect and when they might
    happen. For a developer looking for a way to help, the road map
    can point them at work that needs to be done. It is very
    important that the road map be kept current; it is the
    definitive source of decision information on the project.</p>

    <p>Scheduling takes on a very different flavor for an
    open-source project because many people are volunteers.
    Internal developers can be assigned to tasks based on your
    company's priorities, but outside developers choose what they
    will work on and set their own schedules. We say more later
    about how to do a release, but two points should be mentioned
    here. First, for a typical company-run project, the features
    that will go into the next release are defined, a schedule is
    made up, and the features are then coded. For an open-source
    project this process is reversed: new features are implemented,
    and, when there are a significant number of them, a release
    date is set. Second, setting a release date will motivate
    people who are working on almost finished modules to get them
    done in time for the next release. This process of setting a
    release date and then including in the release only those
    modules that are ready by that date is sometimes referred to as
    the &quot;train model&quot;: any modules not ready must wait
    for the next train (that is, the next release).</p>

    <p>Reliance on volunteers is another reason that it is
    important to assure that the project uses good modular design
    to enable decentralized development. In his book <em>Open
    Source Development with CVS</em> , Karl Fogel points out that
    &quot;free projects optimize in favor of a distributed burden,
    lessening the vulnerability of the module to any one person's
    schedule (or lapse in judgment for that matter)&quot; (p.
    147).</p>

    <p>In a hybrid open-source project directed by a company, the
    scheduling can have some aspects of company-run projects.
    Remember that in such a project, decisions are still made
    transparently, but the volunteers may agree to defining a
    feature set as the primary determiner of when a release will
    happen, as long as the company developers do that work. In this
    case, other features may still be added, and perhaps the
    release will be delayed for important or interesting additional
    features to be completed.</p>

    <p>Deciding what internal developers focus on is a matter of
    private planning. However, if they are all working on matters
    peripheral to the main community activity, that can be
    bad--project leadership requires that they work to help achieve
    community goals. On the other hand, a company doesn't always
    need to demonstrate leadership. For example, your company might
    join an existing open-source project with the sole aim of
    adding a few features or porting it to another platform. But
    for an open-source project that your company initiates,
    ignoring the wishes of the community can be fatal: At best your
    company will be seen as irrelevant and the project will fork,
    and at worst the community will cease to participate and the
    project will be seen as a public failure that only your company
    cares about. In some cases, a company that starts an
    open-source project is best off ceding leadership to the
    community; cases where this makes sense include projects where
    the company is trying to make inroads in open-source-dominated
    markets or where the experts in the area are in the community
    and not in the company.</p>

    <p>In the end, it's the people who write the code and who
    integrate the contributions who have the final say. The phrase
    &quot;show me the code&quot; often comes up in open-source
    project discussions.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="integrating-contributions">
    <h2>Integrating Contributions</h2>

    <p>In a successful open-source effort, many developers
    contribute bug fixes and new features. Although everyone is
    allowed to read the source code archive, only a small group of
    developers are granted permission to directly modify it. In
    some projects, such as Linux or Mozilla, each module has one or
    more owners--the <em>module owners</em> --who are the only ones
    who can edit the source code for that module. Others wanting to
    make changes must submit their contributions to the official
    module owner, who may or may not accept them. Other projects,
    such as Apache, rely on a core group of developers--called
    <em>committers</em> --that jointly oversee the entire project;
    any one of them can modify code in any of the project's
    modules, although major changes are often reviewed and voted on
    by the entire core team. For simplicity, we refer to all the
    developers who can make changes to the official source code as
    module owners, but please keep in mind that some projects do
    not necessarily control access on a module-by-module basis.
    Also, for smaller projects, the original author may act as the
    project owner and be the only person with the right to make any
    changes.</p>

    <p>When a developer who does not have write access to the
    source code submits a bug fix or modification, it is part of
    the job of the appropriate module owner to review the
    contribution and integrate it into the code base if it is both
    well written and in line with the project's goals. Accepting a
    contribution may involve some work, but it is fairly
    straightforward. Rejecting a contribution, however, requires
    some sensitivity.</p>

    <p>Some proposed new features may introduce more complications
    then they are worth or they may be questionable in the first
    place. Module owners need to ensure the quality of the code
    they are responsible for and sometimes need to reject a
    contribution. For the health of the community, however, people
    making contributions should never be made to feel rejected.
    They have donated their time to make a contribution, and you
    want to encourage them to keep working on the project.
    Requesting that they make some changes to make their work
    better is one possible way to do this. Another is to reserve an
    official part of the CVS archive for nonstandard contributions;
    others can see them and incorporate them in their builds if
    they want to. Many open-source developers have gone on from
    receiving constructive rejections of their work to become
    productive project members. A healthy community helps to
    educate and develop its members.</p>

    <p>Module owners must also be aware of the attitude of the
    community to their decisions. Module owners are allowed to make
    decisions only as long as they have the community's respect.
    Their authority is largely based on merit. If enough other
    developers disagree with the direction they are taking the
    project, they will either be replaced or the project will split
    into two factions--that is, the code will fork. It can become
    more difficult when a company sponsors an open-source project,
    because initially all the module owners are company employees.
    Module owners then have a manager to answer to in addition to
    the community. Moreover, that manager may or may not be
    responsive to community feedback. For this reason, it's
    important for a company starting an open-source project to
    educate the management chain and to put in place performance
    goals that reflect the success of the community and the
    open-source project.</p>
  </div>

  <div id=
  "how-decisions-get-made-varies-among-open-source-projects">
    <h2>How Decisions Get Made Varies Among Open-Source
    Projects</h2>

    <p>Roles associated with software development include
    architects, designers, implementors (sometimes called coders),
    quality assurance people (or testers), and release managers.
    Some of these roles have to do with managing or executing part
    of the development process (the implementors, release managers,
    and quality assurance people), whereas others are thought of as
    producing or creating important artifacts associated with the
    software (the architects and designers).</p>

    <p>In the conventional view of software development, the
    requirements, specifications, architecture, and design are
    formal artifacts produced before implementation, although in
    even the most traditional development projects there is
    iterative refinement of them. In open-source projects, if there
    are similar artifacts, they may be either informal or reflected
    in the source code itself. Open source uses continuous
    (re)design, in which the design and even the architecture is
    fluid based on the use of the software and the desires of its
    developers. Any descriptions of the architecture and designs
    typically reside in discussion archives and other peripheral
    documents as well as in the source code itself. Requirements
    and specifications are likewise at best informal, captured in
    archives, source comments, and the source itself.</p>

    <p>The majority of open-source projects have fewer than 20
    developers working on them and rely on a single person, usually
    the originator of the code, to act as a &quot;benevolent
    dictator&quot; making the major decisions. For larger projects,
    decisions are often delegated to the senior developer in charge
    of each code module. Other open-source projects use a more
    democratic method. For example, each Apache Software Foundation
    project has a group of committers who vote on changes to the
    software and on who can become committers. Committers can be
    elected to be Foundation Members.</p>

    <p>We say more on governance in the section <sup><a href="#fn9"
    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9" name="fnref9">9</a></sup> that
    consists of a farm of machines whose sole purpose is to
    continually check out and build the source tree on various
    platforms and then display the status of the builds on a
    continually updated web page. This lets people know when it is
    safe to check in new changes.</p>

    <p>It is also very important to have the most recent stable
    build available for download. This is for your cutting-edge
    users who want the latest features that have been initially
    tested but have not yet gone through a full release cycle.</p>

    <p>To facilitate testing, it is important that the latest build
    (executable) be available for download by the testers. You want
    the smallest delay possible between when a developer checks in
    a fix for a bug and when the testers can download a new version
    containing that bug fix. The faster the feedback received the
    better. In the early days of Linux, Linus Torvalds on occasion
    made several releases of the Linux kernel in a single day.
    That's giving users and developers immediate gratification.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="testing">
    <h2>Testing</h2>

    <p>In a very real sense, everyone who uses an open-source
    application is part of the testing effort. The easier you make
    it for users to report a bug, the more likely they are to do
    so. However, the most significant difference between user-based
    testing in an open-source project and traditional alpha/beta
    testing for proprietary software is that, in addition to
    reporting a bug, some developers will isolate or track down the
    cause, and perhaps even submit a fix for the bug.</p>

    <p>For some open-source projects, there is no formal testing;
    all the bugs are reported from actual use. For some other
    efforts, testers are recruited as part of the release cycle. In
    some sense, people are volunteering to help test code whenever
    they download the latest build or the last stable build. The
    cutting-edge users and developers are the first line of bug
    finders.</p>

    <p>Looking at the quality of Linux, especially in comparison
    with other PC operating systems, we can see how successful this
    user testing can be. Another example is that the early users of
    Mozilla's 1.0 alpha and beta releases filed about 1000 bug
    reports per month.</p>

    <p>Having users do the testing has extra benefits because they
    test not just that the new functionality has been correctly
    implemented but also that the functionality meets the users'
    actual needs. This is combining usability testing with QA.</p>

    <p>It's important to thank your testers. Their efforts do not
    get the same visibility as the developers who contribute code
    or folks who write documentation. They should be acknowledged
    somewhere on the project's website and also in a README file
    that is part of the standard distribution.</p>

    <p>For a larger project with more resources, doing some form of
    automatic regression testing can really help make sure old bugs
    do not recur. Jikes, for example, has a regression testing
    framework--which is itself an open-source project, called
    Jacks. Likewise, the Visualization Toolkit project uses
    extensive automated testing. If full-time QA people are
    available to do more formal testing, then so much the
    better.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="releases">
    <h2>Releases</h2>

    <p>Every time someone checks in a change to the source code,
    that is a new release. This is what open-source projects mean
    by continuous releases. For active developers this is great:
    They are guaranteed that they are working on the latest code.
    They won't waste time fixing a bug that someone else has
    already fixed. Other people can start using their contributions
    immediately--and report any bugs they find in those
    contributions.</p>

    <p>But for some users, continuous releases are less desirable.
    Users want some stability in the programs they rely on.
    However, the amount of stability desired varies from one user
    to the next. Some want to be able to use the latest features,
    whereas others want something really solid and bug-free. It
    should be easy for a newcomer who wants to learn about your
    project to locate and download an executable that is known to
    work and has been well tested. This gives newcomers something
    to try out that will provide the best initial experience
    possible.</p>

    <p>To satisfy these conflicting needs, many projects do a
    series of frequent, small incremental releases using code that
    has been mostly debugged, with infrequent major releases after
    the remaining bugs have been discovered and fixed. So the more
    adventurous users become the QA team to flush out the bugs in
    the minor releases.</p>

    <p>When to do a major release is determined by the current
    state of the code: Have a number of serious bugs been fixed?
    Have significant new features been added? Has it been a long
    time since the last release? If the community decides the
    answer is yes, then the project enters a release cycle aimed at
    creating a stable version suitable for release.</p>

    <p>The release process for an open-source project is very
    similar to that used for proprietary products. The main
    difference is that the open-source process is looser. For
    example, if the code for a new module is fairly stable and does
    useful things, then it may be included in a release even though
    the documentation for it is slim or nonexistent.</p>

    <p>A release manager often is needed to coordinate the release
    process. This includes recruiting testers, coordinating the
    testing process, and even making sure that the testers are
    properly acknowledged afterward.</p>

    <p>The release manager's job also includes helping to decide
    what goes into the release and what is not yet ready. This
    generally involves a code freeze, during which new
    functionality is not being added. Once it has been decided to
    do a new release, developers who are in the midst of writing
    new modules will be motivated to finish them quickly so that
    they can be included in the release. Motivating developers is
    good, but finishing the implementation of a module is not
    sufficient; it also must be debugged so that it is stable. Part
    of the release manager's job is to allow only stable code into
    the release. Even some bug fixes may not be included if the
    benefit of fixing the bug is outweighed by the possibility of
    new bugs that may be introduced by the fix. The release cycle
    is not the time to make big changes to the code.</p>

    <p>In an open-source project (unlike many proprietary
    projects), ongoing development is likely to continue during the
    release process. Developers may want to continue to work on new
    and experimental modules that will not be included in the
    release. Projects that use a source control system such as CVS
    can start up a branch for the release activity while normal
    development continues on the main trunk. There are pros and
    cons to code freezing versus code branching. When code is
    branched for a release, developers can continue the work
    they're doing that's not related to the release; this maximizes
    ongoing work. But the cost is that any bug fixes made to the
    release version of the code must be merged into the main source
    branch, and changes made to the main branch while the release
    was being done can make such merges difficult. When code is
    frozen while a release is being done, developers who want to
    continue to work on new project code can be frustrated when
    they cannot check in their code and test it promptly. Such
    frustrations can sometimes lead developers to abandon the
    project.</p>

    <p>When most of the known bugs have been fixed and the release
    is becoming stable, it is often a good idea to put out a beta
    release. More people are willing to try out a beta version
    because it has already undergone substantial testing. This
    second batch of testers will help catch the remaining bugs.</p>

    <p>Finally, when the last major bugs have been fixed, the
    release is ready to be packaged for distribution and announced
    to the world. It is important that every release be given a
    unique release number so that everyone knows which is the
    newest version and so bugs can be reported against the correct
    version of the source code. Some projects, such as Linux, have
    adopted the convention of giving even version numbers to stable
    releases and odd numbers to untested ones. So in October 2002,
    the latest stable Linux kernel was version 2.4.19, the
    development version was 2.5.44, and the beta (prepatch) for the
    next stable kernel was version 2.4.20-pre11.</p>

    <p>Companies such as Red Hat make their living packaging the
    major Linux releases and selling them to users who value
    stability, ease of installation, and product support. If your
    company plans on offering a branded product based on the
    open-source code, then it may follow a similar model.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="support">
    <h2>Support</h2>

    <p>The various open-source licenses clearly state that
    open-source software comes with no support whatsoever. This is
    generally discussed as an opportunity for third parties to sell
    support, and indeed companies such as Red Hat make good money
    doing so.</p>

    <p>But the support story is not so clear-cut. In fact, often
    the greatest source of support is from the other users and
    developers working on the project. These are the people who
    care about the software the most and know it the best. In a
    successful open-source project, the main mailing list is used
    by people to ask questions about problems they are having and
    quickly get answers. Some of the answers may not be the best,
    but generally with a little persistence people get the
    information to solve their problems. As long as people realize
    that they are asking for help, rather than demanding support,
    then the mailing list can be a major benefit for users of
    open-source software. But for those users who need someone to
    solve their problems for them, purchasing or contracting
    support from a third party is the way to go.</p>

    <p>This is another way that user feedback can help improve the
    software. Developers get to see the problems real users are
    having and can modify the code accordingly. It's also just a
    small step from asking how to do something to suggesting
    something useful that the program could do.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="adding-a-new-module-or-subproject">
    <h2>Adding A New Module or Subproject</h2>

    <p>Contributing an entirely new module is one of the most
    exciting ways a developer can move an open-source project
    forward. This can add totally new capabilities to the software,
    often taking it in an unforeseen direction. But not every
    proposed new module will be a winner--some will be useful only
    to a small group of users, some will never work out, and some
    will just seem wacky--so it is important for the project to
    have a thorough but flexible approval process for new
    modules.</p>

    <p>Many open-source projects have an experimental area where
    anyone can easily set up a new subproject to develop a new
    module. This provides a sandbox for developers to test new
    ideas and make them available to the community to try out.
    Generally the new module is not included in any of the
    project's official releases, but the developers working on the
    new module can create an experimental version that does include
    it and make it available for anyone who wants to download and
    play with it.</p>

    <p>When the community decides that a new module provides
    important functionality, then it's time to move it out of the
    experimental area and make it an official part of the project.
    This can involve lots of effort, because the standards for an
    experimental module are quite different than for an official
    one. For an experimental module, all that matters is that it
    does something useful or neat, but making it &quot;product
    quality&quot; can require adding user documentation (possibly
    including online help), internationalization (I18N<sup><a href=
    "#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10" name=
    "fnref10">10</a></sup>), localization (L10N), accessibility
    (A11Y), usability testing, a build script to add it to the
    project build process, and a test suite; adopting the official
    project look and feel; and polishing whatever rough edges the
    module currently has.</p>

    <p>That's a lot of work, probably more than the original
    developer originally put into writing and debugging the module.
    Bringing the module up to the project's standards requires
    other developers to help out. That could involve employees from
    your company--UI team, graphics designers, technical writers,
    and QA folks--just as if it were a module you had
    developed.</p>

    <p>There's a potential tension between wanting people to
    innovate by creating new modules and having high standards for
    the official product quality. You need to be careful not to
    make too high a barrier that prevents volunteer contributions
    from becoming part of the official release. One way to go about
    this is to let the community decide what the standards are for
    the open-source project, and then your company can choose to do
    additional work--such as writing more complete user
    documentation or more formal testing--to create your own
    branded version. Just be sure to contribute back as much as you
    can to the open-source effort.</p>

    <p>Finally, it's important to periodically go through the list
    of subprojects and weed out those that are not being used and
    are no longer being worked on. Having too many abandoned
    subprojects makes it more difficult for people to find the live
    ones, and it may make the whole project seem dead. Approving
    subprojects and weeding out the dead ones are part of the
    community coordinator's job.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="making-it-happen">
    <h2>Making It Happen</h2>

    <p>As you can see, lots of work is needed for an open-source
    project to be successful. Here is a list of some of the jobs
    that you must commit resources to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Evangelist/community coordinator to encourage and
      coordinate developers, get publicity for the project,
      increase community involvement, host mailing lists, and in
      general just keep the project moving along. (We say more
      about these activities in the section on creating a community
      of developers.)</li>

      <li>Module owners to be responsible for the development of
      the code and to integrate contributions and bug fixes from
      other developers. They also need to participate on the
      project mailing lists.</li>

      <li>Infrastructure support for the CVS archive, mailing
      lists, bug database, and website.</li>

      <li>Website editor to keep the website alive with new
      content.</li>

      <li>People to document the system architecture and record
      reasons for design decisions.</li>

      <li>Buildmaster to oversee the build process and fix problems
      with broken builds.</li>

      <li>Release manager to coordinate release activities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Going open-source is not a way to get something for nothing.
    It takes real work to make an open-source project successful.
    But putting in the required effort can yield a project that
    grows much more quickly than if you tried do to it all by
    yourself. For example, a year after Sun started the open-source
    Tomcat project it had 31 developers with commit access, only 9
    of whom were Sun employees.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="building-a-community">
    <h2>Building a Community</h2>

    <p>Okay. You've announced your project. You really want
    community involvement and participation, not just a user group.
    You've got a website, open mailing lists, a CVS archive, and a
    bug database. Your developers are standing by, eager to join in
    any discussions and ready to accept bug fixes and new features.
    What do you do next?</p>

    <p>You want a healthy community involved with your project.
    This involvement takes many forms. First, you need users,
    people to actually use the software you are creating. John
    Ousterhout, the creator of TCL/TK, has said:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>If an open source software package has a large enough
      number of users (where &quot;large enough&quot; seems to be
      around 5,000-10,000), you can be confident that it is
      functional, reliable, and fairly well documented. To see why
      this is true, consider the users. If they are non-expert
      users, there's no way that 5,000-10,000 of them will use a
      package unless it has these properties ( furthermore, the
      developer would go crazy dealing with all of their questions
      and bug reports). On the other hand, if the users are expert
      and there are that many of them, then if there are problems
      they will simply fix them, which they can do since the
      package is open source.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Having a large number of users makes things real and applies
    pressure on the developers. If you don't have users, you won't
    get developers. If you don't have users, then no one really
    cares about your project anyway and it will not be
    successful.</p>

    <p>The distinction between a user and a developer will depend
    on your project. For Netscape's Mozilla browser, there's a big
    difference: Users run the browser; developers write the code
    that is the browser. For a project that is building a platform,
    for example, Java, there is less of a distinction: Users write
    Java programs; developers extend the classes in the official
    Java packages, most of which are themselves written as Java
    code. Someone writing a Java class library is somewhere in
    between.</p>

    <p>In addition to just using software, which is of course the
    whole point of developing it, the users also help in many ways.
    First, they provide support to other users by discussing how to
    best use the software in their work, by helping to write
    product documentation, by answering questions posted to the
    various mailing lists, and by marketing the project to
    potential new users. Second, they can contribute any user-level
    customizations they make to the product, such as templates,
    macros, or preference settings. Third, they can help shape the
    future development of the product by suggesting improvements,
    identifying problem areas, and participating in design
    discussions. Finally, they help test the product by reporting
    the bugs they encounter; for most open-source projects, users
    act as the QA department. In all these ways the users become
    integral to the development of the software, unlike their role
    in a typical user group.</p>

    <p>Some of your users will have sufficient technical skills to
    also work on the source code. They may contribute fixes for
    bugs that bother them. Others may get more involved by
    contributing code for a minor improvement or participating in
    design discussions on the mailing lists. Some may join in the
    ongoing work being done by the core developers, possibly
    earning the right to commit code to the CVS repository. A few
    may even become module owners.</p>

    <p>There is a tendency in open-source projects to focus on the
    code, with the result that anyone who is not a developer is
    often treated as a second-class citizen. This is bad because
    the expertise and energy of users is a huge resource just
    waiting to be tapped. It's all too easy to become fixated on
    the source code, on the further development of the software
    itself; however, remember the whole point is to create
    something useful that lots of people will use. Writing a good
    tutorial can have a bigger payoff in attracting more new users
    then adding some spiffy new feature. Identifying a subset of
    your user community that has a common interest and creating a
    new mailing list for them to share ideas with each other can
    bring in lots of new members with a similar interest. For
    example, the OpenOffice project noticed that there were
    substantial numbers of community members who spoke languages
    other than English and so they decided to create separate
    mailing lists for German, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, and
    Portuguese native speakers. These native lists have been great
    for building community and have helped to attract new members.
    As of March 2004, there were native-language discussion forums
    in OpenOffice in over two dozen languages.</p>

    <p>Keep in mind that your users and outside developers have
    diverse backgrounds. Some may be computer novices, whereas
    others may have more experience than your most senior people.
    Some will have worked on other open-source projects and have
    firm ideas about how they are run; for others your project will
    be their first involvement with open source, and they will have
    only hazy ideas of how to participate and will need to be
    educated in how open source really works.</p>

    <p>As with all online communities, there is a natural
    progression from newbie, to regular member, to leader, to
    knowledgeable elder. The tone of the community you create will
    determine whether people's involvement will grow or not. If
    suggestions to the mailing lists are routinely flamed or if
    code contributions are harshly rejected, people will not want
    to participate. If the community encourages participation, even
    when the contribution is not very good, more people will be
    willing to participate and the level of everyone's
    participation will generally improve over time. Many
    open-source projects report that some of the current core
    developers started out by making somewhat clueless or
    half-baked contributions, but, by receiving encouragement and
    constructive feedback from other community members, they
    improved to the point of becoming key participants.</p>

    <p>You can expect that as the community grows the number of
    people at any given level of participation will be roughly an
    order of magnitude less than the next lower one. For example,
    about a year after the Jini project was started over 40,000
    people had downloaded the Jini source code, but only around
    4000 had subscribed to the Jini-users mailing list. Of those,
    around 400 people were posting occasional messages, with most
    of the posts coming from a core group of around 40, of which 4
    or so were considered elders.</p>

    <p>As your project grows and develops, many decisions will need
    to be made. These will range from those affecting individual
    developers, such as whether a bug fix they have submitted is
    accepted or not, to ones affecting every developer and user,
    such as when to do a major release and what features will go
    into it. How these decisions are made and who makes them will
    either strengthen or undermine your project's sense of
    community.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="whos-in-charge">
    <h2>Who's in Charge?</h2>

    <p>If people feel that they are involved in the decision-making
    process and that their viewpoints are heard and respected, then
    the community will generally accept whatever decision is made.
    If people feel that a decision is being rammed down their
    throats, then they will object and, in the worst case, go
    elsewhere, possibly forking the source code and starting a
    competing project.</p>

    <p>The exact decision-making process varies from one
    open-source project to the next, but in many it is based on the
    idea of a meritocracy: Those who have demonstrated their
    competency through their work on the project are the ones who
    make the decisions. In many cases, the project lead, often the
    originator of the code, has the final say. Likewise, module
    owners make decisions that affect their module. This works only
    as long as the &quot;benevolent dictator&quot; can maintain the
    respect of the developer community; otherwise, the community
    will call for a replacement.</p>

    <p>Note that even in a meritocracy there will be lots of
    politics at play. First, there is the question of who judges
    whether someone has merit or not. There is no objective test
    that prospective contributors must pass. Instead, they must
    somehow prove themselves to the current core group. If their
    approach to the project is sufficiently different from the core
    group's then they may never be judged worthy. Second, having a
    good idea is not enough; it must be presented to the community
    in a clear manner that meshes with the current vision for the
    project. Even though a single module owner may make the final
    decision about whether to incorporate a new feature, being able
    to muster community support in favor of the feature can
    strongly influence the outcome. In both cases, there is a
    tension between the group's ability to maintain a narrow enough
    focus so as to be able to move forward and being open to
    innovation.</p>

    <p>It should also be noted that a meritocracy based on the
    ability to write code has the direct effect of disenfranchising
    users--including users who are qualified developers, but who do
    not have the time or interest to contribute code to the
    project. Giving a say only to those who have contributed their
    time and effort has a certain appeal, especially if you are one
    of those people, but it has a negative result if the interests
    of those contributors are different from those of pure users.
    For example, a programmer's needs for a text editor are quite
    different from those of a person writing technical articles. So
    an open-source project developing a new text editor could
    easily put all its energy into adding features that make it
    easier to write computer programs rather than into features
    such as for the needs of footnotes or bibliographies. That's
    fine if the vision of the project is to create an editor for
    programmers, but if the original intent is to provide an
    open-source replacement for proprietary programs such as
    Microsoft Word then the project will be a failure. Success
    requires that all the users have a direct say in setting the
    priorities for the project. Letting everyone vote on which bugs
    are most important to fix is a small example of this. In any
    case, developers get the final vote by deciding what they will
    volunteer their time to work on.</p>

    <p>For an open-source project where the majority, if not all,
    of the senior developers work for a single large company, this
    decision-making process can run into problems. Many open-source
    developers are suspicious of the motives of large companies,
    and they will suspect the senior developers of caring more
    about their company's needs than about the good of the
    open-source project. This makes decision making a problem until
    the outside developers get to know the senior developers as
    individuals and have reason to trust them. Even then, people
    will perceive the situation as potentially unfair.</p>

    <p>To counter this, a more democratic process may be required.
    In some open-source projects, the senior developers vote on
    major decisions. For the Apache Software Foundation's projects,
    three positive votes and no negative votes are necessary for
    any decision. Moreover people voting no must give an
    explanation of why they are vetoing the proposal. A vote is
    also required to add a new member to the group of voting
    developers. The Apache HTTP Server Project guidelines and
    voting rules can be found on the Apache website.<sup><a href=
    "#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11" name=
    "fnref11">11</a></sup></p>

    <p>Another solution is to establish a neutral governing board
    that has final say and to which anyone can appeal a decision.
    The Jini, JXTA, and NetBeans projects have done this,
    establishing boards where Sun has only one-third of the total
    votes and the rest of the board consists of well-respected
    community members elected by the community. This has gone a
    long way toward gaining the trust of outside developers by
    showing that Sun cares about the success of the open-source
    project and is not trying to pull a fast one.</p>

    <p>When choosing your company's representatives to such
    governing boards, you need to consider each board's purpose.
    For the Jini project, the board is primarily intended to
    provide technical oversight and so the initial Sun-appointed
    representatives included two of the core Jini architects. For
    the NetBeans project, the board is more of an appeals court and
    so the Sun representative has been someone knowledgeable about
    open source, but not directly involved with NetBeans day to
    day. Such a representative will be more likely to be unbiased
    if any major controversy happens; it also ensures that the Sun
    core NetBeans developers can freely advocate their positions
    without having to stay neutral. If your company is involved
    with other open-source projects, then the company employees
    working on those projects might be excellent potential board
    members for your project.</p>

    <p>The Jini project has gone even further toward democracy by
    putting major decisions to a vote of the entire community. As
    mentioned earlier, Jini technology is a simple distributed
    computing model based on the Java programming language. Among
    other things, it was intended as a model for services--small
    bits of functionality--to discover each other dynamically and
    create a network of interoperating program parts. These
    services could be housed within devices--physically separate
    computing platforms as far as Jini is concerned. Because such a
    model is new, the definition of each service is likely to
    require a maturation period in which an initially immature
    service is defined and released, with perhaps numerous
    improvements subsequently being released. Service definitions
    are specified by Java interfaces (API).</p>

    <p>A problem facing the Jini community was how to maintain the
    consistency and quality of Jini services, where all services
    must conform to the core Jini specifications (it's like TCP/IP)
    but where newly developed services need room to experiment and
    innovate. The community has developed a process that is fair,
    lightweight, and adaptable. It is lightweight because most
    people don't need to use it--they just write up specifications
    for their new Jini services and try to get people to use them.
    Only when they want something ratified or when they want to
    make a change to the core Jini services do they need to have
    the larger community vote.</p>

    <p>To be fair means giving individuals and small companies a
    say equal to that of large companies. It also means recognizing
    that a large company may have many thousands of customers using
    its Jini-based products, and so it deserves a greater say than
    a lone individual. To balance these conflicting needs, members
    are divided into a general house and a commercial house. Both
    houses must approve any proposed standard. Acting as a sort of
    appeals court to oversee the process and further ensure
    fairness is a nine-member Technical Oversight Committee (TOC).
    The initial draft for this Jini Community Decision Process
    (JDP) is described in the Jini constitution.<sup><a href=
    "#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12" name=
    "fnref12">12</a></sup> The current, more detailed version 1.0
    of the JDP was completed in December 2002.<sup><a href="#fn13"
    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13" name=
    "fnref13">13</a></sup></p>

    <p>One final point is that none of the open-source licenses
    tries to describe how the community should be run--if a project
    forks, one branch could vote on everything, whereas the other
    could appoint an individual to make all the major decisions. If
    people do not like the governance structure you choose for your
    project, they may decide to set up a separate community with a
    decision-making process that they find more acceptable.</p>

    <p>Likewise, the community has no direct say in changing the
    license--only the copyright owner of the code can do that.
    However community discussions on the project's mailing list in
    favor of changes to the licensing can be effective. The Mozilla
    project is an example; community feedback helped to shape the
    initial license and has also prompted the adoption of a
    dual-license structure. To give the community direct say, the
    copyright could be assigned to a foundation responsible to the
    community with the foundation's governing board elected by the
    members of the community. Then the community would have
    ultimate control over making changes to the license.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="building-trust">
    <h2>Building Trust</h2>

    <p>If you are just a private individual starting up a new
    open-source project, then you might be able to simply announce
    your project and then sit back and wait for contributions to
    start rolling in. For a company, however, especially a large
    company, there's a suspicion that must be overcome before
    outside developers will feel comfortable contributing to the
    project. Basically, you have to earn their trust and prove that
    you do not have hidden motives. Further, there is a big
    difference between creating a successful users group and
    growing a successful open-source community.</p>

    <p>If potential developers suspect that you will make money by
    selling the code that they contribute, then they are apt to be
    offended, and rightly so. And if they think that they might
    need to pay you in order to use a product that incorporates
    their contributions, then don't expect to receive many
    contributions.</p>

    <p>You must clearly communicate what your business model is and
    that any money you make is for value that you are adding, such
    as higher-quality or additional proprietary features. If you
    really are profiting from the outside contributions made to the
    project, then even if you can explain how they also will
    benefit, it will be an uphill battle to recruit outside
    developers.</p>

    <p>If developers must pay licensing or royalty fees, they will
    be less likely to contribute back to the project. If the
    license itself is too restrictive or seems to favor your
    company too much, outside participation will suffer. If
    publicity seems to slight contributions from external
    developers, then those developers will create negative press
    and leave.</p>

    <p>The more you actually live a true open-source lifestyle, the
    easier it will be to earn the trust of your outside developers.
    Any incidents where your developers, or other people in your
    company, put a business-as-usual spin on things will make it
    harder for the project to succeed.</p>

    <p>For example, Sun's reputation with the open-source community
    increased with the release of NetBeans under the Sun Public
    License and even more with the release of StarOffice under the
    LGPL and the support of Sun for the GNOME project. These
    overcame some of the bad feelings many developers had toward
    Sun because of the way Sun has retained control of Java.
    However, if any future problems arise between Sun and outside
    developers in the NetBeans or OpenOffice projects, the old
    suspicions may immediately resurface and need to be
    addressed.</p>

    <p>It is vital that your company's developers participate in
    the project's mailing lists. This is how the community will
    come to know who they are and what sort of person each is.
    Remember that trust is built up between individuals. How your
    company's developers interact with community members will set
    the tone for the entire community. Because initially all of the
    module owners will be internal developers, how they accept and
    reject outside contributions will either create an atmosphere
    of real community or convince outsiders that it is an effort
    only by (or for the benefit of) your company.</p>

    <p>You should have qualified outside developers receive
    check-in privileges as soon as possible. So keep an eye out for
    any outside developers who are contributing reasonable code;
    after they have made a few contributions, consider granting
    them CVS commit access. The sooner some module owners are
    outside developers, the better, so welcome anyone contributing
    what could be a new module. These are signals to everyone that
    it is a true open-source project. For example, a defining
    moment for the Tomcat project was the 3.1 Release, for which
    the release manager was from IBM and not from Sun. That let
    everyone know that Tomcat was no longer a Sun-only project.</p>

    <p>Because many open-source developers are suspicious of large
    companies, it is important to recognize that it takes time to
    earn their trust and overcome any past mistakes.</p>

    <p>Building trust also applies to people in other parts of your
    own company. When other groups in your company work with you
    through the open-source process, they will understand that your
    project is not business as usual and you will probably have a
    much easier time working with them. You should encourage
    developers outside your work group to contribute and when they
    do, consider granting them CVS commit access where appropriate.
    Note that the process of deciding who qualifies for CVS access
    should be the same regardless of whether a developer works for
    your company or outside of it.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="growing-a-community-of-users-and-developers">
    <h2>Growing a Community of Users and Developers</h2>

    <p>You have a basic choice of sitting back and letting
    potential users and developers find you or going out and
    actively trying to recruit new participants. In either case,
    once people start to contribute to your project, you need to
    actively encourage them.</p>

    <p>If you decide to go out and look for folks, then you need to
    know what types of people you are looking for. Who is your
    target audience? Or rather target audiences, because you need
    to grow both the number of active developers and the number of
    people using the resulting software.</p>

    <p>To attract users, you need something that they can use. If
    all you have produced are some major pieces that will go into
    an actual product, then there may not be anything to use yet.
    This was a major problem with the Mozilla project when it first
    started. Without a working Mozilla browser, there were no
    users, and it was much harder to attract developers.</p>

    <p>Once you have a working product, you increase your users
    just as with any other product: You make it better--easier to
    use with more features, better performance, fewer bugs, and
    better documentation. And you market it. Because the source
    code is publicly available, there should be a free version that
    users can easily download and install.</p>

    <p>When you think in terms of starting with a small or minimal
    working useful piece of software, you encourage users and other
    developers to refine the requirements and specifications for
    it. In this way, open source can be very like the agile
    methodologies that produce many small releases guided by
    customer or user feedback.</p>

    <p>A good user mailing list or newsgroup will also help grow
    the number of satisfied users, who will then help future
    novices. It is extremely important early on to help set a good
    tone on the mailing list. By encouraging group participation,
    you help to grow a real community. Out of this user community
    will come your future contributors, documentation writers,
    evangelists, and customers.</p>

    <p>When the project is just starting, having a single communal
    mailing list is best. Resist the temptation to overdesign by
    creating many lists before any community has developed. As the
    volume grows on the mailing list, the community itself will
    decide when it is time to create additional lists.</p>

    <p>In a traditional open-source project, people start out as
    users and become more involved because they value the product
    and wish to improve it. Again, your developers need to
    encourage people to participate in the design of new features
    and also in their implementation. For minor contributions, this
    can sometimes be frustrating to experienced developers who know
    that they could do it faster and better by themselves, but a
    few kind words now and then encouraging newcomers can really
    help.</p>

    <p>Another source of contributors is other companies. If a
    company benefits from using an open-source product, then it may
    be willing to devote resources to that project. Actively
    seeking other companies to partner with may be a good strategy
    for growing the pool of contributors. Note that when a company
    gets involved, it may add many new developers who are focused
    on one or two modules. It is important that the module owner
    not be overwhelmed by their participation on the mailing lists
    and can promptly incorporate their contributed code and bug
    fixes. It isn't good if they have to wait weeks for their
    changes to get into the official CVS code archive. As soon as
    possible, some of their more experienced developers should be
    granted check-in privileges.</p>

    <p>When working with teams from other companies, do not assume
    that things are going well just because no one is complaining.
    They might be unhappy but not know who to complain to or be
    unsure of what to expect because they are not familiar with
    open source. It is important that your community manager or
    some senior developer informally contact them to ask how they
    are doing and if they are encountering any problems.</p>

    <p>One other source of developers is universities. Providing
    assistance--hardware, software, or funding--to a university
    research program can enlist the aid of large groups of
    students. For example, to promote use of the Eclipse open
    platform for tool integration, IBM announced the Eclipse
    Innovation Grant competition in November 2002 through which it
    would grant a total of $500,000 in awards to university faculty
    members and researchers to use the Eclipse open-source code
    base for teaching or research, or to actively promote the
    growth of Eclipse user communities. IBM also has an active
    Eclipse Fellowship Program to fund university-based research in
    the areas of programming languages, tools, and
    environments.</p>

    <p>Many of these suggestions require your core developers to
    interact with and mentor people outside of your company. This
    can be done only by personal contact. By including community
    work in your open-source developers' performance review
    criteria, you encourage your developers to work with and mentor
    people in the larger community and thereby make the project
    more successful. If they receive the message it's important to
    work with outside developers, but they are evaluated only on
    how much code they've written, then it is likely that they will
    minimize their community participation. Without strong outside
    leadership to pick up the slack, the community will then
    stagnate and the project may become an effort done mostly by
    your company alone.</p>

  <div id="give-folks-a-good-initial-experience">
    <h2>Give Folks a Good Initial Experience</h2>

    <p>It is often difficult for a user to download and install a
    new piece of software. This can be due to a variety of reasons
    such as poorly written directions, the number of steps required
    for a successful install, or the difficulty of correctly
    configuring the software to the specific computer system. If
    your project is really compelling to potential users, then they
    will be highly motivated and willing to overcome whatever
    obstacles are in their way. For example, the first spreadsheet
    programs on the early personal computers created an urgency in
    many people, who needed the functionality of a spreadsheet so
    much that they were willing to ignore how difficult it was to
    use them. Of course, if your project is that exciting, then it
    may be that your business model should be based on commercial
    sales and not open source.</p>

    <p>It is really important to make sure that people have a good
    initial experience when they locate, download, and try out your
    project's product. Making sure that the initial &quot;out of
    the box&quot; experience is a good one can be the difference
    between a successful project and one with no users. Make sure
    that it is easy for users to locate the correct version of the
    product to download. There should be a link on the project's
    home page that will take them directly to the correct download
    page. It should be crystal clear which download is the most
    recent stable release and which is the cutting-edge, buggy
    release that newcomers may not want. If there are known to be
    major problems with a release, then you should have a list of
    all of the major bugs or missing features posted somewhere that
    users can easily find--in fact, they should see the list before
    they try to download, so they can decide if the release is even
    worth their time to try out.</p>

    <p>For most projects, however, the first obstacle people
    encounter may be enough to stop them from going any further. If
    they never hear about your project or can't find the project's
    website, then the project has essentially failed. If it's not
    clear how to download and install the software, folks will give
    up and look elsewhere. If they can't figure out how to use the
    program to do at least something simple or if it crashes on
    them right away, not only are they apt to drop it then and
    there, but they'll also let other people know what a loser the
    program is.</p>

    <p>Any product installation process should be simple and
    straightforward. There should be a clearly written tutorial to
    get people started using the program. After they have had a
    taste of success with it, they will be more willing to put up
    with and overcome problems.</p>

    <p>Trying to guarantee your users a good initial experience
    certainly makes sense as a goal for companies making commercial
    products, but why should an early version of an open-source
    project be so polished? It's certainly true that lots of
    open-source advocates are sophisticated computer users and
    expect early releases from open-source projects to be a bit
    rough. However, they only have so much time to devote to trying
    yours, and overcoming each obstacle eats into the time and
    energy they have available. Too many obstacles and they will
    give up and do something else. Remember, they don't need your
    program--they already make do without it and initially are just
    curious about it.</p>

    <p>In some ways, this is a good situation, because it forces
    you early on to think about how people will actually install
    and use your program, instead of your waiting until the end of
    the development cycle to tackle it, if then. Dealing up front
    with user concerns always makes for a better final product.</p>

    <p>Creating a good initial experience also goes for outside
    developers joining your project. What sort of reception do they
    get when they make their first bug reports, contribute their
    first bug fixes, or initially post to the mailing list? Are
    they welcomed or flamed? Does a more senior developer mentor
    them or reject their efforts? Even if their contributions are
    ultimately rejected, it is crucial that they feel that their
    efforts were appreciated and that they, as people, were not
    rejected.</p>

    <p>An example of how to encourage outside contributors happened
    early on in the Jini project. One of the first code submissions
    had major problems. Rather than rejecting it, Ken Arnold (the
    module owner) basically rewrote it. Ken then talked privately
    with the original author about the need for the revisions and
    then announced to the world that the author had made this great
    contribution to the project--without mentioning that it had
    been rewritten. This broke the ice, and more outside developers
    started to contribute.</p>

    <p>Other obstacles that developers face include how difficult
    it is to understand and work with the source code: Is it
    modular? Is there readable system-level documentation of the
    program's architecture and data structures? Is the build
    process straightforward or long and complex? Do they need
    special tools to compile or work on the code? These are all
    potential problems that can make developers decide not to
    devote their free time to working on your project.</p>

    <p>Obstacles can hinder your project in other, more subtle
    ways. During the first few years of the Jini project, lots of
    energy was taken up addressing problems all newcomers seemed to
    face when they first tried to run an example Jini service. The
    problems stemmed from the underlying complexities of how the
    operating system handled multicasting (or not, in the case of
    Windows 2000), the network configuration, having the correct
    security policies set in the Java virtual machine, and other
    such issues that are outside of Jini's control but that are
    needed for Jini to function. Until the Jini project included
    tools to automatically detect these problems and then help
    users track down solutions to them, the beginner was faced with
    a major effort before achieving any success with the Jini
    technology. Some novices make use of the Jini FAQ and mailing
    list archives to solve their problems, whereas many more post
    their plight to the main mailing list. Going into its fifth
    year, the community continues to be incredibly supportive of
    new user problems, but it does take up the time of more senior
    members of the Jini community.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="a-community-website">
    <h2>A Community Website</h2>

    <p>People's first, and possibly only, exposure to your project
    is apt to be through your project's website. People working on
    your project will use the website as a place to meet, to post
    their work, and to find out about the current status of the
    project. The information presented on your website and how it
    is organized can help your project to be more successful. A
    good website helps create a sense of community.</p>

    <p>At a minimum your website needs to have pages that do the
    following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Describe your project and its goals.</li>

      <li>Provide access for downloading the most recent releases,
      the latest experimental builds, and the current source
      code.</li>

      <li>Explain how to get involved.</li>

      <li>List recent news items concerning the project.</li>

      <li>Tell how to sign up for the project mailing lists and how
      to search the archive of previous messages.</li>

      <li>List the key developers working on the project and how to
      contact them.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Larger projects will also have web pages for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Tutorials and examples of how to use your product.</li>

      <li>User documentation.</li>

      <li>Developer documentation, including an up-to-date project
      road map.</li>

      <li>Accessing the files in the CVS archive.</li>

      <li>Reporting, searching, and editing bugs in the bug
      database.</li>

      <li>A list of FAQs about the project.</li>

      <li>Descriptions of each module.</li>

      <li>Pointers to web pages for commercial products associated
      with the project.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Many of these items will be created by your community
    members either directly (for example, someone writing an FAQ)
    or through community activities (for example, an online
    discussion of what milestones are in the project's road map).
    Other pages report on what community members are doing. Some
    projects allow participating developers to create additional
    web pages, possibly giving them personal directories to store
    files in where they can upload their own web pages or exchange
    files with other developers.</p>

    <p>As you can see, the pages on the website must cover a large
    and diverse range of material. This material needs to be
    organized to meet the different needs of the various parts of
    the community. So there may be one section of the website
    dedicated to users and another more focused on developers'
    needs. The project's home page needs to clearly direct visitors
    to the web pages appropriate for their interests.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the look and feel of the site will probably change
    as you move from the very public home page to more specialized,
    remote parts of the website. In a home, there is an intimacy
    gradient from the public parts of the house to the more private
    regions visited only by family and close friends. Similarly, a
    website's outer face should usually be more polished and
    standardized, while, further in, individual developers may use
    a variety of designs for the web pages that describe their
    subprojects.</p>

    <p>As the project grows and changes, so too must the website.
    The community itself should be a major source of suggestions on
    how the website can be improved. Make sure it is easy for
    community members to suggest changes to the site and
    participate in its continual redesign. Some of this is easy to
    do by just posting on the web pages an email address for
    suggested changes. That is good mainly for minor corrections or
    adding pointers to web pages on other websites. For more
    substantial changes, it is usually better to have a website
    subproject that volunteers can join.</p>

    <p>There is also a constant need to keep the website fresh. New
    content in the form of articles, status updates, news stories,
    and usage tips must be added regularly. Many people do not
    subscribe to the project mailing lists but rely on the project
    website to keep them up-to-date on things. This point came out
    quite dramatically when the OpenOffice project conducted a
    survey, advertised on all of the major OpenOffice community
    mailing lists and also on the website. When the results were
    analyzed it became clear that over half the people who
    responded did not read any of the mailing lists but instead
    relied solely on the website for news about OpenOffice.</p>

    <p>The website is like a newspaper and, if the same old
    articles are there week after week, people stop visiting. One
    important project role is that of website editor. Just as a
    newspaper needs an editor, so does your website. The editor
    needs to solicit articles from developers, gather news related
    to the project, highlight work being done, profile key
    developers, and generally make sure that there is a good reason
    for anyone interested in your project to regularly visit your
    website.</p>

    <p>A large project, such as OpenOffice, NetBeans, and Jini,
    will need its own independent website; it will also have the
    budget to pay for one. Smaller projects can join an existing
    website that hosts open-source projects, such as
    SourceForge,<sup><a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id=
    "fnref14" name="fnref14">14</a></sup> Java.net,<sup><a href=
    "#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15" name=
    "fnref15">15</a></sup> or the Free Software Foundation's
    Savannah.<sup><a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"
    name="fnref16">16</a></sup> If a company has many small
    projects, it may make sense to gather them together on the same
    website. For example, Sun has a website for smaller Sun
    open-source projects called SunSource.net<sup><a href="#fn17"
    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17" name="fnref17">17</a></sup>
    and IBM has a similar site.<sup><a href="#fn18" class=
    "footnoteRef" id="fnref18" name="fnref18">18</a></sup> Appendix
    A contains URLs for other companies' websites.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="meetings">
    <h2>Meetings</h2>

    <p>Mailing lists, websites, and other flavors of online
    communications are good, but to have a real community it is
    important for community members to actually meet each other in
    person. Being able to put a face with a name and to really
    interact with people--hearing their voices, seeing their facial
    expressions--is what is needed to create a true sense of
    community. Meeting in person also helps you to see people as
    individuals and to break down the barriers between
    companies.</p>

    <p>Community meetings help the project to develop its own
    culture, which reinforces the community by helping to define a
    group identity and building stronger bonds between members.
    Each community will have its own flavor based on its shared
    values, its philosophy, the personalities of major members, and
    other unique properties. Attending a community meeting gives
    members a shared experience. It helps to create a larger
    context by exposing people to aspects of the project that they
    would otherwise not have seen.</p>

    <p>Meetings are excellent places to do the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Discuss and vote on major issues--sometimes it is much
      easier and quicker to reach consensus when meeting in
      person.</li>

      <li>Have individuals or subgroups present their work to the
      larger community.</li>

      <li>Conduct demonstrations of new products or
      subprojects.</li>

      <li>Connect developers and users.</li>

      <li>Start up a new subproject--people can more easily share
      their enthusiasm in person than through email.</li>

      <li>Acknowledge people who have contributed to the
      project.</li>

      <li>Perform informal market research and test out new
      ideas.</li>

      <li>Generate excitement for the project.</li>

      <li>Create a greater sense of community.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So it is very important that your project schedule regular
    community meetings. These can be full events in themselves or
    just a part of some larger event--the NetBeans community has
    scheduled meetings as part of the JavaOne conference and also
    at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention. Meetings can involve
    the entire community or just members of a subproject. If your
    project has working groups, committees, or a governing board
    that can be scheduled as part of a larger projectwide meeting,
    that will make it easier for individuals to justify traveling
    to participate in them.</p>

    <p>Consider using formats other than the typical presentation
    and panel sessions. One idea is to have a <em>fishbowl
    discussion</em> . For a fishbowl, place five chairs in a circle
    in the middle of the room with the audience arranged around
    them. The session starts with four of the chairs
    occupied--usually with key project members--and one empty. The
    rule is that conversation can continue as long as at least one
    of the chairs is unoccupied--as soon as all five are occupied,
    the conversation must halt until someone gets up and leaves.
    The people initially in the four chairs start a discussion on
    some matter of importance to the community. Only the people
    sitting in the central chairs may speak. Someone in the
    audience who wants to say something must come up and sit in the
    empty chair, at which point one of the other people in the
    circle must leave (usually someone who has already spoken). The
    resulting discussion often has a more thoughtful tone than in
    other formats, partly because each person gets only a few
    chances to speak and so wants to make the most of each
    opportunity, and partly because the discussion is not dominated
    by back-and-forth discussions among a few people. At the Jini
    Community meetings, it has become something of a tradition to
    end the meeting with a fishbowl discussion about issues facing
    the community and the future of Jini technology.</p>

    <p>Make sure to leave time for informal activities so people
    can meet up with folks with similar interests. Avoid the urge
    to schedule every minute. Encourage people to hang out together
    by having a reception with good food and drink. Have a group
    outing to some local landmark. Eat meals together. Make sure
    that your meeting space has places for people to sit together
    and talk. Sometimes the most valuable discussions happen
    outside the official sessions.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="corporate-source-issues">
    <h2>Corporate Source Issues</h2>

    <p>Engaging a community can be more difficult in a
    corporate-source project than in an open-source project. This
    has to do with the nature of identity in the two arenas. People
    working for a company sometimes have a special corporate
    identity. By this we mean that employees adjust their behavior
    and attitudes to align themselves better with the corporate
    culture. For example, an employee might display more loyalty to
    the company while in the workplace than may be natural for that
    employee at home or at a ball game. But a commons-based project
    requires candor and a critical eye from participants in order
    to realize the benefits of the slowly dawning insights that
    commons-based approaches encourage. In an open-source setting,
    identity is a pseudonym because it may not be easy to find out
    someone's true identity behind the email address or people may
    not be inclined to look hard for that real identity. But in a
    company, it's easy to find out who is behind each email address
    and one's candid comments might figure into performance reviews
    and other employment decisions. This fear of exhibiting beliefs
    and behavior that would be good for a corporate source project
    but which might be considered contrary to the rah-rah culture
    of the company might inhibit employees and limit the
    effectiveness of the project.</p>

    <p>Moreover, some developers are afraid of exposing their
    weaknesses--such as poor language skills--to an audience that
    could include managers who can fire them or withhold projects,
    raises, and promotions. When the context is a judgmental
    company project, some potential contributors might fear to
    expose a weakness that is otherwise not apparent. In an
    open-source project, in contrast, language skills do help a
    contributor, but there is generally tolerance for people who
    are not speaking their native language or who happen to be less
    skilled at writing than others in the project. Although the
    day-to-day dealings in open-source and corporate projects can
    be equally difficult and judgmental, corporate projects
    additionally brim with employment-related dangers. Whereas
    open-source projects thrive on candor, bottom-up action, and
    merit-based advancement, corporations may encourage strict team
    play, command-and-control, and hierarchy.</p>

    <p>Sometimes experts are hesitant to expose their expertise
    because that might jeopardize their competitive advantage in
    the company. This hesitancy could boil down to a desire to get
    credit for contributions--in some cases people are more
    comfortable with disclosing information when there are audit
    trails that reveal who is accessing their disclosed
    information.</p>

    <p>Project leaders and other managers advance by taking
    responsibility for a tough project and then delivering. But to
    some this can appear hard to do when control is relinquished to
    others, which is what happens when other people in the company,
    who do not report to the project leader or manager, are granted
    the right to check in or have write access to source code. And
    so project leaders and managers may not accept a corporate
    source project or may do so only reluctantly and therefore try
    to limit broad participation, at least unconsciously.</p>

    <p>These are all impediments to building a strong community for
    a corporate source project. For corporate source to be truly
    effective, there needs to be a corporate culture that respects
    and celebrates speaking honestly.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="three-principles-for-community-building">
    <h2>Three Principles for Community Building</h2>

    <p>We end this section with three basic community design
    principles from Amy Jo Kim's book <em>Community Building on the
    Web</em> (pp. xv-xvi). We highly recommend this book, which
    describes the strategies needed to create a thriving online
    community.</p>

    <p>First, design for growth and change. Don't overdesign your
    project up front. Start off small and focused. Grow in response
    to the needs of your community members. This echoes the
    development philosophy of open source: Start with a small but
    useful working version of the software and permit the community
    to continuously (re)design it. The poet, William Stafford, in
    speaking of writing, has provided a good definition of art:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>[Art] is a reckless encounter with whatever comes
      along.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Building a community is an art.</p>

    <p>Second, create and maintain feedback loops. You need to
    listen to your community in order to meet its needs. No one
    likes to be just a cog in someone else's machine. Doing this is
    harder than it sounds. Try to find someone to direct the
    evolution of the community part of your open-source project who
    is not heavily invested in the technology under development.
    Such an outsider is likely to care about the community more
    than the technology and therefore will be able to listen
    better.</p>

    <p>Third, empower your community members over time. As your
    project &quot;grows and matures, your members can and should
    play a progressively larger role in building and
    maintaining&quot; the project. A common failure of the
    meritocracy is that the old guard hang on too long. Some elders
    develop a fear that only they know the true path for the
    software and that permitting someone else--anyone else--to have
    a definitive say will blow it. You should encourage your
    leaders to move on earlier rather than later. The following
    quotation is from an interview with a short-term participant in
    open source:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>There's another [open-source] project whose technology I
      use and I want to develop further, but the &quot;benevolent
      dictator&quot; is simply a dictator ... the few developers
      who stick around are like that too ... who needs
      that?&quot;<sup><a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id=
      "fnref19" name="fnref19">19</a></sup></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Taken together, these three principles will help you to
    nurture and guide the excitement and energy of your users and
    developers to grow a successful project with an engaged
    community. The results will be much more than you could have
    done by yourself.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="ending-an-open-source-project">
    <h2>Ending an Open-Source Project</h2>

    <p>Open-source projects have a natural life cycle. They may
    start out slowly and then have a long period of growth when
    many new features are added and bugs fixed. Eventually, they
    can mature and go into a maintenance phase when people still
    use the software, but no further major development is done. As
    your project matures and you achieve your main business goals
    for it, you may want to reallocate resources to other efforts.
    Also, a change in your company's situation might force a
    decrease in its level of involvement. It is natural for the
    founder of an open-source project to leave in order to move on
    to other interests. However, this does not necessarily mean
    just abandoning the project.</p>

    <p>Right from the start of your project, you need to make it a
    practice to encourage community members to increase their
    participation. You should recruit active outside developers
    into the core team, giving them as much responsibility as they
    will take on. Each module owner should identify another
    developer who can take over as the new maintainer for the
    module if need be. For example, each module in Mozilla has an
    owner and one or more <em>peers</em> who can also approve code
    for check-in into the module; a peer is an obvious choice for
    replacing the current module owner. Involving outside
    developers in the running of your project early on is healthy
    for your project and creates a pool of people that you can turn
    the project over to should you need to.If your company decides
    to reduce or end its involvement in an open-source project,
    there are certain steps you need to take in order to assure a
    smooth transition and to avoid creating bad feelings toward
    your company. This is all very similar to how your company
    handles the end of life of its products in order not to
    antagonize its customers. Your company probably has a special
    process to approve ending a product. It should have a similar
    approval process for ending or decreasing participation in an
    open-source project that it has sponsored.</p>

    <p>As soon as the possibility that the company may need to
    decrease its level of involvement with the project arises, you
    need to plan out how to disengage. In your internal
    discussions, you may need to remind your managers and others
    that the company must not abruptly end its involvement--they
    need to understand that it will probably take several months to
    ramp down and turn the project over to the community.</p>

    <p>It is important that you announce your company's intentions
    to your community as soon as possible. You want them to hear it
    from you, not through rumors or an article in the press.
    Remember that what you do here may hurt the company's
    reputation, making it harder to sponsor or participate in other
    open-source projects in the future.</p>

    <p>If your company is currently paying for your project's
    website and it plans to stop doing so, then you need to work
    with your community to find a new home for it. Possibly one of
    your community members might be able to take over the hosting
    of it, or you may need to make use of one of the free
    open-source hosting services, such as SourceForge. You should
    help migrate over all of the website contents, CVS trees, bug
    databases, email archives, and other community documents. Be
    sure that the source code does not disappear when your company
    stops its support because your company may have a legal
    obligation to make sure the source code continues to be
    available for some specified time period. For example, the GPL
    requires the source code to be available for 3 years after the
    last release was distributed.</p>

    <p>You need to decide the level of future involvement your
    company wishes to have with the project, if any. This includes
    whether you want to encourage your developers to continue
    working on it as part of their jobs or on their own time if
    they so choose. For example, will you permit your developers to
    take time to answer questions about the source code that only
    they may be able to answer?</p>

    <p>How your company ends its involvement will leave a lasting
    impression. By doing things right, your company will be
    remembered for generously contributing its efforts to make the
    project a success. If your company just abandons the project,
    then it will be thought of as a company that doesn't care about
    open source and that is not a good partner.</p>

  <div id="joining-an-existing-open-source-project">
    <h2>Joining an Existing Open-Source Project</h2>

    <p>So far we have been discussing open-source projects that
    your company starts and provides the leadership for. If your
    work can build on an open-source project that already exists,
    then your needs are apt to be better met by joining that
    project and not by trying to start a new effort. You would
    definitely want to join an existing open-source project if your
    goal is just to port an open-source application to a new
    computer platform or to add a new feature to an existing
    open-source application or library.</p>

    <p>Joining an already established open-source project is much
    easier than starting your own project because someone has
    already set up the infrastructure (website, CVS code archive,
    mailing lists, and bug database) and a community of developers
    is already working on it. Thus you can focus your efforts on
    adding the new functionality you need.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="license-issues">
    <h2>License Issues</h2>

    <p>Before joining an open-source project you need to check that
    its licenses are compatible with your business goals. For
    example, suppose that you are planning to combine the existing
    open-source code with proprietary code. If the project is using
    a GPL-style license then you will not be able to do so.
    However, if it is using any of the other common open-source
    licenses, including LGPL, then you will be okay.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="becoming-a-good-community-member">
    <h2>Becoming a Good Community Member</h2>

    <p>In theory, your involvement can be as limited as merely
    contributing a few bug fixes or small new features. Generally,
    your business goals will require you to do a bit more, and you
    will need to actively participate in the project and establish
    yourself as a valued community member.</p>

    <p>Each open-source project has its own flavor, just as each
    Internet newsgroup or mailing list does. People are known to
    the community by their previous posts and contributions. It is
    very important that, before you start posting to the project
    mailing lists, you first lurk for a bit. Read over some of the
    mailing list archives to get a feel for how the project
    operates: Who is influential, what are the current major
    issues, and how are issues decided? You should also search the
    archives to see what has already been discussed about your
    particular areas of interest.</p>

    <p>When you first post to the project to announce how you want
    to be involved, it is very important that you acknowledge the
    good work already done and explain how you plan to add value.
    You want to avoid appearing arrogant. You may also need to
    alleviate people's fears that your company is somehow trying to
    rip them off--sometimes just explaining why it is important to
    your company is enough to do that.</p>

    <p>Keep in mind that you need to establish your reputation as
    an individual working on the open-source project. Other people
    working on the project don't care so much about your position
    at your company. What they care about is the quality of your
    posts and code contributions. The more they respect you, the
    easier it will be to work with them.</p>

    <p>This might be a good place to mention some reasons why you
    should contribute any modifications you make back to the
    open-source project. First, it's the right thing to do. The
    community has made the code available to you, so you should
    return the favor by giving it any improvements that you make to
    the code. Second, it will help you build better relations with
    the community. If you are perceived as a good community member,
    then you are more apt to be listened to in discussions about
    the project's future. Finally, if you do not contribute your
    changes, then with each new release of the software you need to
    manually add your changes to the latest version of the source
    code--if the code has changed in ways that are incompatible
    with your modifications, you may need to do significant work to
    reincorporate your changes. When you give your changes back to
    the community, people who make additional changes will do
    whatever work is necessary to keep your code from breaking. By
    not contributing your changes, with each release you will need
    to do that work; you will be paying what is often called the
    stupidity tax.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="the-open-source-development-process">
    <h2>The Open-Source Development Process</h2>

    <p>The key to open-source development is that it is an open
    process. This is especially to your benefit when joining an
    existing open-source project. By looking at the project's
    website, you should be able to learn everything you need to
    know about how the project is organized. In particular, you can
    read the project road map to get an understanding of what
    development is planned. You can identify the individuals
    responsible for the modules you will be working on. You can
    read the mailing list archives to get a sense of the project's
    history and character.</p>

    <p>As you begin to work on the project, you need to make sure
    that you maintain this openness. Make sure that you use the
    project's public mailing lists and not a list internal to your
    company. Involve the community in any major design decisions
    that you need to make.</p>

    <p>Being open in your intentions is quite important in your
    dealings with the project's module owners. These are the people
    who have the final say as to whether your proposed
    contributions are accepted into the official code base. That
    being the case, it is important that you post a message
    announcing your intentions--what you want to do and how you
    plan to do it--before doing any major work. This will give the
    module owner and the other developers a chance to comment on
    your plans and evaluate how they fit in, or do not fit in, with
    the community's development plans. It is likely that you will
    need to make your work more general or extend the functionality
    to satisfy the rest of the project. It is also likely that the
    revised plan will be better overall. Note that if all you want
    to do is implement an API to your own proprietary code, that
    will not get much, if any, community support.</p>

    <p>Some of the discussion may become a bit heated; many
    developers express themselves quite bluntly. Don't let the
    flames get to you. Remember that many of the people you are
    dealing with are volunteers and some may be quite
    inexperienced. Your replies should be aimed at the community
    and not at the &quot;idiot&quot; who just flamed you. Refer to
    the earlier section on &quot;Posting Etiquette&quot; for more
    on how to handle yourself when posting.</p>

    <p>For more details of the day-to-day mechanics of an
    open-source project, please see the earlier section &quot;How
    to Do Open-Source Development.&quot;</p>
  </div>

  <div id="getting-your-contributions-accepted">
    <h2>Getting Your Contributions Accepted</h2>

    <p>To be effective when doing open-source development, it is
    very important to create realistic expectations on both sides.
    We have already talked about making sure that the community,
    and especially the module owners, have a clear expectation of
    what you want to contribute to the project. This will greatly
    increase the chances that your code will be accepted when you
    finish it. Another factor in your favor is that most people
    running an open-source project want their application to become
    popular and be used everywhere, so if your company is
    interested in modifying it a bit so it will be of interest to
    more people, you already have a leg up.</p>

    <p>It is also important that you have realistic expectations
    about how the open-source project functions. For example, it
    may release a major stable version once a year, so if it has
    just finished a release cycle, then anything you contribute
    won't be officially released until the next year's major stable
    version. Likewise, if the project is in the middle of a release
    cycle, there may not be much community interest in discussing
    the wonderful new features that you are planning on--you may
    need to wait until the release is done before people have the
    energy to discuss major new features.</p>

    <p>Another potential problem you face is that the particular
    module owner you are working with may be very slow in accepting
    your contributions. This may be because the module owner is
    busy with other matters or doesn't have much time to devote to
    the project. It may also be that your team of several
    developers is writing code much faster than the single module
    owner can digest it. If this is the case, you need to gain the
    trust of the module owner so that you can be allowed to check
    code in directly. It helps if you respect the coding style
    already used in the module when you write bug fixes, patches,
    or small changes.</p>

    <p>A major role of the module owner is to guarantee the quality
    of the code base by screening contributed code. Some module
    owners are happy to share this screening function with
    developers who have shown that they are competent. Although
    module owners have the last word on what goes into their
    module, they are fine about letting delegated individuals check
    in the code when it is ready, as long as the general design had
    been discussed on the project's mailing list beforehand.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, however a module owner refuses to delegate, and
    this can create a major problem. Some module owners insist on
    understanding every line of code in their modules, which is
    fine for small modules but may be impossible for a very large
    one. This is especially true for some original project owners
    who have never been willing to delegate responsibility to the
    various modules but instead insist on being a bottleneck that
    all major changes need to go through. If this turns out to be
    the case and the module/project owner is unwilling to change,
    you may need to muster community support for sharing
    responsibility. Otherwise, your only option is to fork the
    project. That is what happened with Emacs back in 1992: The
    XEmacs project came about when Lucid Inc., tried to contribute
    major changes to the display code and Richard Stallman refused
    to accept them.<sup><a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id=
    "fnref20" name="fnref20">20</a></sup> A decade later, the two
    projects still remain separate.<sup><a href="#fn21" class=
    "footnoteRef" id="fnref21" name="fnref21">21</a></sup></p>

    <p>A successful example of a company joining an existing
    open-source project is IBM's work on the Linux operating
    system. In an interview on Slashdot, the IBM Linux Kernel
    hackers talked about getting their changes accepted into the
    Linux code base:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Question: Is Linus accepting your changes well? How
      directly do you submit patches, and what are your experiences
      on the overall Linux kernel development style?</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Answer: Linus himself is wonderful about accepting patches
      on technical merit alone. He doesn't &quot;grade&quot; them
      differently if they come from ibm.com or mit.edu. We submit
      patches the exact same way that everyone else does: append
      the patch, mail to Linus and CC linux-kernel. If it's good,
      it gets in. If it sucks, you get flamed.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>However, the submission process can be more complicated
      than first appears. Often, you need to figure out who is
      maintaining a particular area of code, followed by talking to
      them to gauge if someone else is already working on the same
      thing. Once you submit your code to them and the appropriate
      list (isn't always lkml ...), you may not get a response.
      This can be discouraging, but you have to find out why, or
      just simply resubmit, over and over and over. But, once you
      have a reputation, it does get easier to get quicker
      responses.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Sometimes it's frustrating when you've put a lot of effort
      into something that doesn't get accepted, but there's
      normally a good reason for it. Even work that doesn't get
      accepted can influence other people's thinking and
      development in the future. On the flip side you can also just
      point out problems and other people fix them for you, so in
      general you win more than you lose;-) <sup><a href="#fn22"

  <div id="open-source-within-a-company">
    <h2>Open Source within a Company</h2>

    <p>Everything mentioned so far about running an open-source
    project or joining an existing one also applies to corporate
    source, where all of the users and contributors are employees
    of your company. What changes when everything is done within a
    company is that the potential audience is much smaller, and
    depending on the company's culture, it may be more difficult to
    communicate and work with other participants.</p>

    <p>In the normal world of open source, people working on a
    project come together because of their common interest in the
    project and generally do not have other connections between
    them. Sometimes volunteers might be in competing companies and
    that might influence their working relationship, but by and
    large everyone acts as individuals, albeit with their own
    personal technological biases.</p>

    <p>Inside a company, however, there can be substantial barriers
    to cooperation and a tendency to use the official hierarchy of
    the company to force both how decisions are made and what
    developers will work on. This is very much at odds with the
    idea of creating a community-based project. When you are
    working within your company, there can be lots of pressure to
    do things the standard company way. In a company-sponsored
    open-source project, you can fight against this kind of
    pressure by pointing out the bad press that would ensue, but
    this tactic does not apply to internal projects.</p>

    <p>This highlights the need to have strong executive
    sponsorship for corporate source projects. Without it, the time
    employees spend working on corporate source projects will often
    be questioned by their managers, and in hard times resources
    for the project will be the first to be cut. This is a typical
    problem--the work is good for the company as a whole but is not
    a priority for any specific department. It can take lots of
    nurturing to get a company's culture to embrace the
    cross-company cooperation needed for corporate source to be
    successful.</p>

    <p>To justify a corporate source project, it helps to be able
    to point to successes within the company due to using the tools
    developed by the project. The crudest way to do this is just to
    measure how many times the tools have been downloaded. That
    gives some measure of interest in the project and can be useful
    for potential users--it highlights what others have found
    useful in the past. Another measure is to look at the number of
    people contributing to the project and the parts of the company
    they are in.</p>

    <p>The normal wisdom is to try to minimize any barriers between
    an open-source project and a potential user. So we advise not
    requiring users to register in order to download. However, for
    their corporate source effort HP does require employees to
    register in order to download a tool. This, then, provides
    information on where in the company a tool is being used and
    enables HP to follow-up to see how it is being used. Part of
    the follow-up is an email message to the author or authors of
    the tool. This provides the authors with evidence of the use of
    their contributions, which can be used during performance
    reviews; it also provides an incentive for the authors to
    contribute more by improving the tool or contributing others.
    Thus, in this case, what would otherwise be a barrier is
    actually an enabler.</p>

    <p>One of the major problems faced by efforts to encourage
    software reuse is making developers aware of existing code.
    Likewise, for corporate source, if customer engineers do not
    know that there's a great tool that a corporate source project
    has developed, they will never use it. It is vital to make sure
    that when good tools are developed that this be advertised
    across the company to all those employees who might benefit
    from it. This requires communication between parts of the
    company that traditionally do not interact much. It also calls
    for communication at the grassroots level rather than through
    the normal organizational channels. Messages from executive
    sponsors can help to make the corporate source projects more
    visible.</p>

    <p>At HP Labs, the code repository was handed over to the
    corporate librarian, who organized it for easier search and
    retrieval. This constant attention to the contents of the
    repository for the purpose of making it easier to retrieve made
    a significant difference in the use and usefulness of the
    repository.</p>

    <p>This is part of a common thread for the use of open source.
    The source code is produced by developers, who have, in
    general, the mindset of an engineer. Engineers are good at
    looking at a complex situation, understanding it, and then
    either repairing it or designing something that helps make it
    better. That is, they are good at puzzling things out. For many
    engineers working on an open-source project, once the code is
    done, everything is done. Perhaps this attitude comes from the
    belief that other people are like engineers and that therefore
    anyone should be able to figure out the rest. For example,
    engineers are sometimes poor writers because they believe that
    once the sentences are more or less on the page, the meaning
    can be puzzled out.</p>

    <p>Therefore, we recommend that, for the documentation, the
    website, building the community, organizing meetings, and
    anything else that is not engineering the source code, you find
    people who are good at those things and who value them. The
    developers will appreciate it--perhaps without knowing why.</p>

  <div id="how-to-do-open-source-development-1">
    <h2>How to Do Open-Source Development</h2>

    <p>Doing open-source requires transparency and openness, and
    this extends to you, too. If art is a reckless encounter with
    whatever comes along, so is a successful open-source project.
    You need to give up some control and be willing to accept the
    direction the community takes the project because that is
    likely to be the direction where success lies.</p>
