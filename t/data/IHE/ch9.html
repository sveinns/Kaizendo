  <h1>9. What To Avoid--Known Problems and Failures</h1>

  <p>As you work to move your project forward, it is inevitable
  that you will make some mistakes. How you respond to them can be
  critical to your project's success. If you are honest with your
  community about what was done and take steps to correct matters,
  then your project can move forward with strengthened mutual
  respect between you and your community. If you refuse to admit
  that there is a problem or ignore the wishes of your community
  members, then they will have less trust in you and your
  intentions. This is especially critical for large companies,
  because outside developers often start off with a low level of
  trust concerning the company's motives. Any act that reinforces
  their fears hurts your project's chances of success. When your
  actions demonstrate your respect for your community members'
  opinions, you earn their trust and improve the chances of your
  project recovering from any future problems.</p>

  <p>In this section, we look at some problems that can cause
  open-source projects to stumble. We hope that by being aware of
  them you can avoid them in your project.</p>

  <div id="not-understanding-open-source">
    <h2>Not Understanding Open Source</h2>

    <p>The first problems can arise when people making decisions
    about whether to use open source for a project do not
    understand how open source works. A typical failure is for
    decision makers to not believe the philosophical tenets of open
    source (see <sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"
    name="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>

    <p>The reality is that even under a strong open-source license
    such as the GPL only the actual source code of the application
    is affected. Other open-source licenses, such as the LGPL,
    Mozilla, and BSD, make it easy to combine proprietary and
    open-source code. There are real issues about what IP an
    open-source project will share, but they are not as horrific or
    all-devouring as people uninformed on the details of open
    source might fear. Note that because open-source licenses have
    yet to be thoroughly tested in court, lawyers are prone to be
    overly cautious when they first read an open-source
    license.</p>

    <p>Many people believe that the point of doing open source is
    to get hundreds of outside developers to work for them for
    free. When this doesn't happen--and it almost certainly
    won't--they declare the project a failure. Moreover, managers
    who believe that open source is just a way to cut costs may not
    allocate sufficient resources to the project--starving it to
    death.</p>

    <p>A related misconception is that you will get hundreds of
    developers contributing lots of random low-quality code that
    you will somehow need to deal with. This just doesn't happen.
    If you are lucky, you might get a number of outside developers
    experimenting with your source code trying to fix bugs or make
    improvements, but you will never hear from most of them. Like
    most people, developers do not want to appear foolish in a
    public forum. If they think that their potential contributions
    are not so great, they will most likely never show them to
    anyone. In fact, your problem is more apt to be the opposite:
    trying to convince potential contributors to submit code that
    they feel is less than perfect.</p>

    <p>A common mistake is believing that a company can open source
    a project to get good PR while playing the same old proprietary
    game. The outside world will quickly see this for the sham it
    is, and no one will join the project. Doing an open-source
    project for the wrong reasons will probably get you a lot of
    bad press coverage and alienate outside developers.</p>

    <p>A different type of problem is starting to occur as more
    people learn about open source: People sometimes believe that
    any open-source project they create must work exactly the same
    way as an existing open-source project. Projects such as
    Apache, Mozilla, and Linux are being held up as exemplars of
    the only way to run an open-source project. Although it is
    important to learn from successful open-source projects, we are
    still just beginning to understand the landscape of open
    source. To succeed requires adopting an open-source attitude
    and innovating new ways to do things.</p>

    <p>Another mistake is not understanding that starting an
    open-source project is like launching a new product. They have
    similar life-cycle issues, the most important being that
    neither can be ended abruptly without upsetting your customers,
    which includes the community in the case of an open-source
    project. Open-source projects, like products, require an
    end-of-life plan. For more details, please refer to the section
    on <a href="IHE-56.html#92889">Ending an Open-Source
    Project</a> in Chapter 6.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="dont-needlessly-duplicate-an-existing-effort">
    <h2>Don't Needlessly Duplicate an Existing Effort</h2>

    <p>In pure voluntary open source, there generally will be only
    one open-source project in a given area. Innovation and
    invention are still possible, but the open-source philosophy
    is, as much as possible, to resist diversity and instead to
    press forward with a single solution with maximum effort. The
    few instances where there are two open-source projects trying
    to produce similar results are due to political issues: GNOME
    happened because of unhappiness with the license used by KDE,
    XEmacs came about because of a disagreement over how to add
    display support to Emacs, and Linux started up while AT&amp;T
    was battling legally with Berkeley over BSD.</p>

    <p>There are only so many open-source developers interested in
    a given area, and it is hard enough to create one community of
    them, let alone two. So if there is already an open-source
    project with goals similar to yours, then you should endeavor
    to join that project. If there is some very good reason why you
    cannot join with them--and it had better be an extremely
    compelling reason, such as they are using GPL and your business
    aim is to produce a proprietary version--then you should
    rethink whether you should be doing open source at all.</p>

    <p>Sometimes diversity is what's needed. If you decide to start
    a project building something with the same basic intent as an
    existing open-source project, you need to understand that you
    will get fewer volunteers and that the differences must be
    clear and distinct. Over time, you might convince people that
    your differences are worthwhile and thereby attract more
    developers and users; and over the very long run you might be
    in a position to merge back with the original open-source
    project once the relative importance and attractiveness of the
    different design and implementation decisions become clear
    through use.</p>

    <p>The story of XEmacs is illustrative here because it is
    perhaps the first instance of a commercial company working on
    free or open source as part of a business strategy, and it was
    also probably the first and most visible fork of an open code
    base.</p>

    <p>In 1991, a company named Lucid, Inc.,<sup><a href="#fn2"
    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2" name="fnref2">2</a></sup> was
    working on a product called Energize, which was an integrated
    development environment (IDE) for C and C++ on Unix. The design
    of this development environment involved very tight integration
    among the various tools: compilers, linkers, debuggers,
    graphers, and editors. The IDE needed a powerful editor to tie
    the whole thing together, and the Lucid designers chose Emacs.
    Moreover, the IDE was graphics based: It assumed a window
    system such as X rather than the character-oriented terminals
    of the day.</p>

    <p>The then-current version of GNU Emacs from the Free Software
    Foundation was Emacs 18, which was a terminal-based editor
    relying on simple character placement for its visual display
    rather than on a graphics-based environment, which is standard
    today. At the time, there was another version of GNU Emacs
    called Epoch that had been developed at NCSA; this was a set of
    patches to Emacs 18 that gave it much better GUI support.</p>

    <p>Also at that time, the next major release of Emacs, Emacs
    19, was expected to integrate features from Epoch, but was long
    overdue. The Epoch maintainers themselves saw Epoch as an
    interim measure, awaiting the release of Emacs 19.</p>

    <p>The developers at Lucid didn't want to tie themselves to the
    soon-to-be-obsolete Emacs 18 or to Epoch because those code
    bases were considered obsolete even by their maintainers. The
    Lucid developers wanted to use Emacs 19; the idea was that
    Energize would operate with the off-the-shelf version of Emacs
    19, which most people would already have installed on their
    system anyway. In that way, Energize would make use, to some
    extent, of tools developers already had and were already
    using.</p>

    <p>But because Emacs 19 wasn't done yet, Lucid decided to
    provide funding and resources to help get Emacs 19 finished.
    Many of the Lucid developers were fans of the Free Software
    Foundation and contributed to free software projects, so all
    their work on Emacs 19 was released under GPL, and they
    assigned copyright on all their work back to the Free Software
    Foundation. Lucid had no proprietary interest in Emacs per
    se--it was simply a tool that would enhance the value of their
    proprietary product, and they hoped there would be good PR
    associated with releasing the GUI-based Emacs when Emacs 19 had
    been delayed so long. Among the other work Lucid did for Emacs
    was to produce a user manual, which would be required for the
    proprietary product.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the relationship with the Free Software
    Foundation broke down, primarily for two reasons:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>There was a dispute over the design of a hypertextlike
      addition to Emacs.</li>

      <li>There was a dispute about how display and redisplay could
      best be done on window systems such as X.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Moreover, the Free Software Foundation was not in a position
    to work as quickly as Lucid needed, so Lucid bundled its work
    into what became Lucid Emacs and released it as a GPLed
    open-source editor.</p>

    <p>After Lucid went out of business in 1994 (for unrelated
    reasons), Lucid Emacs became XEmacs. To this day, XEmacs is
    about as popular as FSF Emacs because it still provides
    features and a design that many people find superior to the
    FSF's version.</p>

    <p>As of fall 2003, the XEmacs project was looking at merging
    back into FSF Emacs, but there were still too many
    irreconcilable differences in the way the two projects viewed
    technical, programming, design, and organizational matters to
    make a merge possible. Although some commentators consider
    XEmacs to have been a divisive fork, others consider the
    competition between the two groups as positive for the rapid
    advancement of Emacs over the last decade.</p>

    <p>If you decide to start a competing project it is very
    important that you establish good relations with the developers
    of the existing project. The last thing you want is to have
    them bad-mouthing your project on forums such as Slashdot.
    Also, you probably share many common goals with them and there
    are apt to be many subprojects you can work on together, such
    as establishing common file formats.</p>

    <p>There will sometimes be cases where creating a competing
    open-source effort cannot be avoided. For example, when Sun
    released their StarOffice code as OpenOffice it overlapped with
    two existing open-source projects: Gnumerics and AbiWord.
    StarOffice was an existing proprietary office suite built to
    compete with Microsoft office. The lead developer for Gnumerics
    had been engaged in conversations with Sun about this overlap
    before OpenOffice was announced, and, as a result, he viewed
    the OpenOffice project in a good light and was receptive to
    working with Sun. However, no one on the AbiWord project was
    consulted before or after the OpenOffice announcement; worse,
    one of the AbiWord developers tried to start a discussion on
    one of the OpenOffice mailing lists about developing a common
    XML file format, but never received any replies from the
    StarOffice engineers. The result was that the AbiWord
    developers became suspicious of Sun's motives and did not work
    with Sun, and both efforts are the worse because of this.</p>

    <p>One final point about creating a competing open-source
    project: Do not expect any people working on existing projects
    to switch to your project. Your outside contributors will come
    from people who have not yet gotten involved with either
    project, and you will be in direct competition with the other
    project for potential new developers. In the OpenOffice
    example, none of the Gnumerics or AbiWord developers switched
    over to work on OpenOffice.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="licensing-issues">
    <h2>Licensing Issues</h2>

    <p>The license you choose can create problems if it is
    unfamiliar to your target audience or inappropriate for your
    project.</p>

    <p>It is a bad idea to create a new license for your project.
    There is a set of existing, mature open-source licenses that
    open-source developers are familiar with, and it is unlikely
    that your concerns are not addressed by one of them. If people
    are unfamiliar with a license they tend to be suspicious of it
    and shy away from the project. When Sun first introduced the
    Sun Community Source License (SCSL), no one quite knew what to
    make of it; it was also hard to understand. Using a new license
    requires taking on a large community education effort--time
    that might be better spent working on your project.</p>

    <p>The Mozilla project has decided that it wants to be able to
    engage more with a number of projects that use the GPL. As a
    result, it is in the messy process of contacting all the people
    who have ever contributed code to Mozilla to get their
    permission to multiply license the code under MPL, GPL, and
    LGPL. This highlights two problems: how letting contributors
    hold the copyright for their contribution prevents changing
    licensing terms and how the choice of license can limit who
    will work on the code.</p>

    <p>Beware of trying to change either the license or the
    contributor agreement after your project is underway. Sometimes
    doing this is no problem; for example, OpenOffice changed from
    requiring contributors to assign copyright of their submissions
    to Sun to requiring contributors to sign a joint copyright
    agreement (JCA), which gave contributors more rights and was
    accepted by the community almost without comment. However, when
    the NetBeans project, which had not previously required
    copyright assignment, announced it was adopting the same joint
    copyright requirement for contributors, several community
    members complained that Sun was acting unfairly, because it
    took away the right of exclusive ownership. Had NetBeans
    started with a JCA, it is likely that the issue would never
    have arisen. Part of the problem with almost any change you
    make is that it will act as a lightning rod, opening the door
    to larger-scale criticism if your community has major
    unresolved issues with the way you are leading the project.</p>

    <p>In general, when a company sponsoring an open-source project
    decides to make a major change to the license, the code, the
    architecture, the community, or anything else visible and
    important, the outside community will tend to view such
    decisions with suspicion. It will wonder whether there is some
    hidden, sinister reason for the change that is not decipherable
    and hence represents a trap. Therefore, make changes with care
    and involve the community as early as possible in discussions
    about important changes.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="design-issues">
    <h2>Design Issues</h2>

    <p>Earlier we have mentioned that low-code quality can be an
    issue. Similarly, a poor or otherwise deficient system design
    can lead to less success than could be hoped for. In large
    part, successful open-source projects have been either copies
    of good designs (Linux, for example) or have been designed by
    extraordinary designers. In some cases, their work had already
    been proven in the form of a series of excellent designs, and
    in others they were new talents in the making.</p>

    <p>A company should think carefully about how good a design it
    is thinking of offering as an open-source project. In most
    cases, a company should offer software designed by proven
    designers or else do a careful design review before releasing
    the code, followed by revisions if needed.</p>

    <p>An interesting but complex example of this is NetBeans
    versus Eclipse--this illustrates the design quality issue and
    also the first-mover myth. NetBeans started as a student
    project (originally called Xelfi) in the Czech Republic in
    1996. The goal was to write a Delphi-like Java IDE in Java. A
    company was formed around this project, called NetBeans. Sun
    acquired the company in 1999 and soon thereafter open sourced
    the code. Eclipse was designed and initially implemented by
    OTI, a Canadian company that had previously been acquired by
    IBM. OTI had extensive experience developing programming
    environments. Eclipse was released as open source several years
    after NetBeans.</p>

    <p>The two designs differ dramatically in maturity and quality.
    Part of this has to do with the experience levels of the two
    design groups, but some has to do with when the designs were
    done and the different knowledge levels--1996 versus 2000 and
    students versus older professionals. The later Eclipse design
    has a sophisticated but easy-to-handle plug-in architecture
    with XML manifests, which reflected the growing use of XML that
    was apparent to OTI but hidden in the future for the NetBeans
    student team.</p>

    <p>At this point (spring 2004), Eclipse is regarded as superior
    and has more mind- and market share, but NetBeans has a
    considerable following and is making design and architecture
    changes. Nevertheless, any company would be wise to be sure of
    the quality and maturity of a design before releasing it.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="code-issues">
    <h2>Code Issues</h2>

    <p>One of the first hurdles an open-source project faces is
    whether the code is complete and builds a working application.
    The classic complaint about Mozilla in its early days was that
    the source code Netscape released was incomplete and could not
    make a working web browser. The Mozilla team was committed to
    the work, so the project continued. Once a working browser
    began to emerge, more casual contributors have also been able
    to participate.</p>

    <p>This is also a common problem for small projects that are
    started because someone has a cool idea: A group of people may
    exchange messages about the idea and suggest ways to improve
    it, but somehow no one ever gets around to writing any code!
    Remember that open source only works to incrementally improve
    what's there--if you have only design ideas, then that's what
    the community will improve. Someone needs to write the code for
    a minimal but working version before the community will
    contribute any code.</p>

    <p>A second hurdle is making sure that the user succeeds when
    trying out your application for the first time. This was a
    noticeable problem with Jini, not because of a problem with the
    Jini code but rather because of a problem configuring Windows
    systems to properly support multicasting. The lesson here is
    that even though your code is fine, problems with other
    software may cause your project to suffer. You need to go to
    some lengths to anticipate initial usage patterns and skill
    levels of the users when code is released to the community. In
    the Jini case, it was expected that mostly Solaris users would
    try out Jini and that any Windows users would be able to figure
    out how to configure multicast properly. This expectation
    proved to be false on both counts.</p>

    <p>Another stumbling block occurs when outside developers have
    trouble navigating the source code. This could be because the
    code is too difficult to understand (in which case it should be
    rewritten), there is inadequate system documentation, or the
    code base is too large. Developers who want to work on the
    OpenOffice project have a steep learning curve due to the
    tremendous amount of code involved. This is a particularly
    common problem as a project moves from being proprietary to
    open source because of the vastly different levels of developer
    involvement--even an incredibly well-documented proprietary
    project still assumes a full-time commitment from a new
    developer.</p>

    <p>Marc Fleury and Juha Lindfors wrote in &quot;Enabling
    Component Architectures with JMX&quot; about how modularity
    increased open-source productivity in the JBoss project:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Modularity in open source is not just a good idea.
      Modularity is the only way a project can mature. Successful
      open source projects are usually measured by the number of
      people that participate in the development. It is common for
      very successful teams to have a tightly knit core team of
      developers working on core functionality, but the key to
      growing the codebase is to enable lots of developers to work
      on modules around the core.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>JBoss 1.0 was near completion when the core developers
      came to a simple conclusion: it was too hard for the casual
      developer to come in and contribute over the course of a
      week. One would have to spend at least a week to understand
      the code before making any contribution. The situation was
      typical of second generation open source projects: lots of
      people wanted to participate but very few could actually do
      so.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>For the third iteration, JBoss embraced JMX. Within a
      week, an alternate SOAP-based invocation layer was submitted
      to the JBoss group. Modularity is needed for open source
      development and management. JMX is a natural way to enforce
      modularity in a design. The increased productivity and the
      ease of component integration to the server has made JBoss
      and JMX a success.<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id=
      "fnref3" name="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>A related problem cropped up in the JXTA project. The JXTA
    source code was deliberately released early so that the
    community could help design it. This led to some developers
    being confused about which aspects of JXTA were not yet defined
    and which had just not been documented yet. Once adequate
    documentation was written that made this clear, the discussion
    was able to move forward smoothly.</p>

    <p>A different type of problem can happen when a project has a
    slow release cycle. One way that the outside world judges how
    well a project is doing is by how long it has been since the
    last release. If a project goes too long without a release,
    people will start to consider the project dead or a failure.
    For example, many people thought that the Mozilla project was
    in trouble after its first year because no working browser had
    been released. The frequent releases starting in mid-2001,
    leading up to version 1.0 in June 2002 and continuing since,
    have dispelled this feeling and now people outside of the
    Mozilla project have good evidence that it is alive and making
    progress.</p>

    <p>If your project has not released anything for a long time,
    you should consider putting less into your next release and
    trying to do smaller, more frequent releases. You should also
    make sure that your project website is updated regularly--a
    stale website is another indication of a dying or dead
    project.</p>

    <p>Another potential problem relates to subprojects. As we
    discussed in the earlier section <sup><a href="#fn4" class=
    "footnoteRef" id="fnref4" name="fnref4">4</a></sup> For
    example, as part of the Apache XML Project, the Xerces XML
    parser appeared first making it difficult for another XML
    parser, the Crimson subproject, to be adopted. In fact, the
    best parts of Crimson have been merged into the Xerces code
    base and work on the Crimson subproject has been halted.</p>

    <p>A problem comes from believing that developing the code is
    all that is required. If all of your attention is on developing
    the code, you are likely to lose track of your main business
    goals. For example, if ubiquity is a goal, then marketing the
    technology to potential partners should have a high
    priority--internal development resources should be focused on
    helping partners succeed. If you can get a large company such
    as IBM or HP to adopt the technology, you can be sure they will
    contribute their own developers to help work on the code.
    Unfortunately, the natural tendency is to try to do everything
    yourself, and so larger opportunities are often neglected.</p>

    <p>Another way this problem can hurt your project is if the
    developers, both internal and external, are the only ones to
    decide on the project's future direction. The whole idea of
    open source as a meritocracy focused on coding tends to
    disenfranchise anyone who does not contribute code, which means
    that users, UI designers, marketing people, and the like are
    often not able to fully participate. This results in software
    that is designed by developers for developers, and this is why
    much open-source software is not appropriate for the general
    public. If you are seeking &quot;world domination,&quot; then
    this can be a major problem that you need to overcome.</p>

    <p>One way to make the focus go beyond the code is to actively
    make roles for nondevelopers such as UI designers and
    documentation writers. For example, NetBeans has a
    communitywide mailing list dedicated to the design and
    discussion of UI issues. There is also a NetBeans project
    focusing on UI development and issues, plus a process through
    which other developers can get UI design assistance from the
    members of the UI project. When the NetBeans project first
    started, there was a hesitancy to add nondeveloper roles like
    this because that wasn't something that the high-profile
    open-source projects such as Apache or Linux did. You may
    encounter similar resistance.</p>

    <p>It should be noted that the UI community traditionally has
    worked in a test-first design atmosphere in which usability
    testing takes place before committing anything to code, so
    there could be a basic mismatch of working styles between your
    UI folks and the open-source developers. This has been known to
    hurt open-source projects in general, so you should make sure
    that the UI folks you include in your open-source project are
    educated in continuous (re)design and buy into the
    approach.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="trying-to-control-too-much">
    <h2>Trying to Control Too Much</h2>

    <p>One of the surest ways to cripple an open-source project is
    for the original developers to refuse to give up control. At
    best this turns potential outside developers into a user group,
    and at worst it kills the project. There are many ways that the
    original developers can try to keep control.</p>

    <p>A common mistake is that the internal development group
    believes that it does not need to change how it works. Very
    often the internal developers continue to use a private company
    mailing list to carry on discussions about project issues.
    Although not every email message needs to be sent to the public
    project mailing list, if essential design discussions are
    carried out in private, then one of the main benefits of open
    source--feedback from users and outside developers--is lost. A
    further problem is that when the internal developers do post to
    the rest of the community, they are announcing what they have
    decided rather than starting a community discussion. For a
    successful open-source project, the internal development team
    needs to shift its email discussions to the project's public
    mailing lists.</p>

    <p>The other major way that internal developers keep control of
    the development process is by keeping a private code archive,
    often one that relies on a proprietary code versioning tool
    instead of CVS. Some projects do not even have a public code
    archive, just tar<sup><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id=
    "fnref5" name="fnref5">5</a></sup> files with the source code
    for the most recent release. This sends a clear message to
    potential outside developers that they are second-class
    citizens who can look at the code but never touch it
    meaningfully--in fact they cannot even see the most recent
    changes but need to wait until the public copy is updated. A
    real open-source project has one public code archive that all
    developers use, although not everyone will have full
    write-access to it.</p>

    <p>Another problem arises when developers want their design or
    code to be perfect before letting anyone else see it. A major
    shift in attitude is needed to go from a proprietary
    development environment where, in many cases, no one ever looks
    at your code, to an open-source world where everyone may see
    what you've done, warts and all. Whether it's a single
    developer or the entire internal development team, waiting too
    long before releasing a design or code is a mistake that hurts
    the overall project. It is important that everyone thinks in
    terms of a work in progress, developed in the open to maximize
    possible feedback from others. Remind folks that nothing is
    final; it is always subject to modification as the project's
    needs change.</p>

    <p>A more general problem is common to both proprietary and
    open-source projects: developers and managers try to make a
    master plan and then carry it out. Planning is good, but,
    carried to the extreme of not adapting to change, it can hurt
    your project. For example, some open-source projects try to
    figure out all the appropriate mailing lists and set them up so
    they will be ready when the project is first announced.
    Unfortunately, the needs of a project that has just started up
    are often quite different from those of one that has been
    running for a while. A better approach is to start with one or
    two main mailing lists and to create more lists only when the
    number of daily messages grows too large. Engineering in
    general often tries to do the &quot;right thing&quot; in one
    step rather than taking a number of smaller steps in whatever
    direction currently seems best. A decision maker who believes
    strongly in master planning will probably not buy into the
    fundamental philosophical tenets of open source (see
    <sup><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6" name=
    "fnref6">6</a></sup></p>

    <p>This problem can often be seen when core developers refuse
    to engage with outside developers in design discussions on the
    project's mailing lists--often the core developers don't even
    read the public mailing lists. Refusing to listen to community
    concerns hurts the project because it both kills a sense of
    community and results in developing the wrong product. Keep in
    mind that approximately half of all software projects fail, not
    for technical reasons but because they produce a result that
    does not match the needs of the target audience. Feedback from
    the community in an open-source project increases the
    probability that what is produced is what is wanted. Make sure
    you listen to what your community members say; they are
    probably right.</p>

    <p>If your community encounters difficulties in working with
    your developers because of any of these problems, then you
    should not expect much in the way of outside contributions. Any
    external developers interested in your project will probably
    work well outside the core area that your internal developers
    have laid claim to. Contributions of new plug-ins or new
    modules are possibilities; major improvements to existing
    modules are not.</p>

    <p>Even if you have been doing everything correctly, the
    community will mostly leave improvements to the core to you
    until there are visible or a significant number of outside
    developers working on core modules. That's why it is very
    important to publicize any outside developer activities or
    contributions to the core area, to break down the view that
    your company handles everything related to it. This will take
    time, so be sure that the metrics you use to measure the
    success of your project reflect this.</p>

    <p>This is not a problem just for company-sponsored projects;
    traditional open-source projects also encounter it. For
    example, in April 2003 a fork of the XFree86 project was
    started because of the feeling that the core team was
    controlling development too tightly and not listening to the
    rest of the community. Problems identified by the community
    included limited development resources (fewer contributors than
    for much smaller open-source projects), slow release schedules,
    lack of cooperation with other projects such as KDE and GNOME,
    and an opaque development process (core team using a private
    mailing list and no information available on the XFree86 home
    page on how to become an XFree86 developer). Part of the
    problem came from the way the project was initially structured
    in order to satisfy requirements of a contract with X.org. The
    rest came from not changing the decision-making process as the
    project grew. More details can be found in an online interview
    with a former XFree86 core team member.<sup><a href="#fn7"
    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7" name="fnref7">7</a></sup></p>

    <p>The day-to-day operation of a project offers many
    opportunities to make mistakes by people trying to retain
    control. Creating a real community requires that the community
    participate in making decisions. There is no real community
    when the only developers who can check in code to the CVS
    archive work for your company, where every important module is
    owned by a developer employed by your company, or where the
    governance board consists solely of your company's employees.
    So grant outside developers the right to check in code as soon
    as possible, put an outside developer in charge of a module as
    soon as possible, and have outside developers on your
    governance board.</p>

    <p>You can alienate outside developers if your company's
    employees are automatically given check-in privileges while
    outside developers have to earn them by making good
    contributions. This is a common mistake for open-source
    projects with a core team from a single company. It is
    important that all developers be treated according to the same
    standards regardless of which company they work for. Sometimes
    new developers at your company may have made contributions that
    the outside community doesn't see because they have handed over
    their code to the module owner in private, so be sure to make
    the activity of new folks visible to all.</p>

    <p>Another mistake some open-source projects make is for the
    module owners to be too slow to accept outside contributions
    and check them in to the official code archive--or even worse,
    to refuse to accept them. This might be because the module
    owner is too busy to deal with any contributions from the
    community. It might also be because the module owner is being
    too controlling over what goes into the module. Part of the
    module owner's job is to maintain the quality of the code, but
    another, equally important job is to be responsive to the
    directions set by the community.</p>

    <p>If another company is contributing so much code that the
    module owner becomes a bottleneck, then it is important that
    one or more of the outside contributors be granted the right to
    also check in code. The alternatives might be that few will
    make additional contributions or, more likely, that the outside
    developers will fork the project, as happened when the XEmacs
    developers started a second open-source project to develop
    Emacs faster and in a different direction than the original
    Emacs effort.</p>

    <p>In summary, one of the worst things you can do to your
    open-source project is to try to control it too much. Although
    other mistakes you could make will slow down or limit your
    project, your keeping too much control will minimize outside
    contributions and make it likely that someone will fork the
    project. Rather than trying to control everything, you should
    provide positive leadership. If you set goals that the
    community agrees on, then everyone will be working together to
    advance the project. If you don't engage the community, you
    will lose it because everyone will stop trying to work with you
    and go elsewhere. One final point is that not all engineers and
    managers are cut out for open source: If they refuse to give up
    control, then they may do more harm than good for your
    project.</p>

    <p>Many of these problems stem from not thoroughly buying into
    the philosophy and practices of open source. If the development
    team and management will not buy into loosening control and
    valuing active community participation, you should abandon
    pushing for using an open-source methodology in your
    company.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="marketing-issues">
    <h2>Marketing Issues</h2>

    <p>A big mistake many company-initiated open-source projects
    make is not actively marketing themselves and the applications
    they are creating. No marketing means fewer users and fewer
    contributors. For a low-key effort this may be fine, but if you
    really want your project to take off, people need to hear about
    it.</p>

    <p>When they hear about it is also important. Some companies
    make a big announcement well before the project is underway and
    the code is available. This can drum up quite a bit of interest
    in the project, but if there's nothing for potential outside
    contributors to do, it can be a wasted opportunity. For
    example, in mid-July 2000, Sun announced that the StarOffice
    source code would be made available, and created a project
    website at Openoffice.org. This generated lots of interest and
    many people flocked to the Openoffice.org mailing lists.
    Unfortunately, there was no documentation about the soon-to-be
    released code, and only a few, junior StarOffice developers
    participated on the mailing lists. As a result, potential
    community members ended up spinning their wheels speculating
    about how StarOffice worked until the code was finally released
    in mid-October and more senior members of the StarOffice
    development team joined the mailing lists. If you were having a
    party at your house, you would not think of making your guests
    wait outside for hours before letting them in, and, if they did
    have to wait outside you would go out and welcome them, not
    leave them to fend for themselves.</p>

    <p>Big announcements that get major press coverage are great
    for your project--when they have real content and are not
    simply hype. Many marketing and PR people are trained to sell
    benefits (and never mention possible drawbacks) as part of
    making announcements, but to technical people expecting to hear
    about a down-to-earth open-source project, such selling can
    sound like hype. Many marketing and PR people do not consider
    it worthwhile to make announcements in which they cannot sell
    benefits, and so you end up having relatively infrequent, large
    announcements with long gaps between them. During these gaps,
    people might conclude that your project is dead because they
    haven't heard any recent news about it. This happened to the
    Jini project in the several-year interval between when the
    technology was first announced and when products based on Jini
    began to appear in the marketplace. Any new technology will
    have a similar interim period. Following a huge initial
    announcement with a very long and noticeable silence will
    invite people to think the project has failed. You should make
    sure that the many small but significant events associated with
    your project are properly communicated to the public. Frequent
    short mentions of your progress lets people know that your
    project is alive and well. An ideal way to communicate current
    news of your project is to post it on your project's
    website.</p>

    <p>Letting your project website become stale is a surefire way
    to make people think that your project is dead. Many people
    interested in your project never subscribe to the project's
    mailing lists--they periodically surf to your project's website
    to see what's happening. If the project's home page hasn't
    changed, they may conclude that no major work has been done and
    are less likely to check again. Make sure that someone is
    assigned to update your website on a regular basis.</p>

    <p>One of the worst marketing mistakes a company can make is
    failing to give proper credit for the work done by outside
    developers. For example, back in December 1999 at a large trade
    show, Sun announced the release of a Linux version of the Java
    2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) that had been done in
    collaboration with Borland Software Corporation (at the time of
    this incident, it was named the Inprise Corporation; it was
    originally named Borland International Inc.). The press release
    failed to mention that much of the work that lay behind this
    version of J2SE had been done by the Linux Blackdown Porting
    Team, a group of open-source programmers devoted to Java. The
    open-source community was stung by the omission and started to
    lose trust in Sun. It turned out that this major error happened
    because the marketing person writing the press release was
    unaware of the work done by the Blackdown project. Sun
    immediately released another announcement giving proper credit
    to the Blackdown team, and the Sun engineers in charge of the
    Linux port personally apologized to the Blackdown group.
    Promptly admitting the mistake and correcting it was crucial to
    Sun's regaining trust with the open-source community.</p>
  </div>

  <div id=
  "tension-between-an-open-source-project-and-the-rest-of-your-company">
  <h2>Tension between an Open-Source Project and the Rest of Your
  Company</h2>

    <p>The Blackdown incident highlights another mistake: Sun
    failed to publicize participation by Sun engineers in the
    Blackdown work and other open-source projects. If people inside
    of Sun had known about this, then the press-release mistake
    would never have happened. Moreover, many in the open-source
    community are unaware of Sun's many contributions to
    open-source projects, which causes Sun to not receive the
    credit it has earned. According to the Orbiten Free Software
    Survey<sup><a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8" name=
    "fnref8">8</a></sup> done in May 2000, Sun was in fact ranked
    as the second largest contributor of code to open-source
    projects. Your company needs to let others know about its
    contributions to open-source projects to get the credit it
    deserves--but without overemphasizing or hyping its
    participation.</p>

    <p>It's not enough that everyone working on your open-source
    project interact appropriately with the outside world, you also
    have to deal with the rest of your company. If others inside
    your company do not understand why you are using open source
    and the implications of that for their work, then your project
    can run into major trouble. Open-source projects need different
    resources than proprietary ones and have different constraints
    on how they operate. If this is not understood by those outside
    your project, then they likely will work against you in the
    normal internal politics that go on inside every company.</p>

    <p>One mistake your open-source project can make is to fail to
    market itself within your company. Moreover, your message needs
    to have a different emphasis from the one used for people
    outside of your company. You need to communicate how the goals
    of your project help further your company's business goals. If
    you fail to do this, then your project may be seen as
    irrelevant and other, proprietary efforts will be given
    precedence. This marketing must be an ongoing activity,
    especially when there are changes in upper management.</p>

    <p>You must educate people at your company about what metrics
    will be used to measure the success of your project. These are
    likely to be quite different from the more familiar metrics
    used for proprietary projects. Anyone opposed to your project,
    for whatever reason, will have a much harder time proving it a
    failure if everyone understands the appropriate metrics for
    measuring it.</p>

    <p>The results of a lack of internal marketing and poor metrics
    can be devastating to your project if your company hits hard
    times and needs to look for people to lay off. This happened at
    Sun in 2001 when the size of the Jini development team was
    reduced. Particularly hard hit were those folks working on
    community issues, including the main community manager (who was
    also one of the original developers of Jini) and the person
    working on updating the Jini.org website. These were very
    visible cuts, and the community began to conclude that they
    signalled that Sun was pulling back from Jini technology. It
    took several messages from Sun executives to reassure the
    community that Jini was still important to the company.</p>

    <p>A common management mistake we have seen is to have people
    trying to serve two masters. Developers helping to grow the
    community while writing code to meet internal deadlines for
    proprietary work will feel pressure from the company to make
    the proprietary work higher priority. It is necessary to
    separate developers into those focused on the open-source
    activities of the project and those doing work on proprietary
    projects. Otherwise, local pressure from managers and coworkers
    will ensure that the proprietary aspects are given priority. A
    failure to include community-related metrics in the performance
    reviews of those involved with open-source activities is a
    common mistake, with the direct result that those community
    activities tend to be neglected.</p>

    <p>The worst type of mistake that projects make is to try to
    cheat or put something over on their communities. This could be
    as minor as sneaking code into the code base or as major as
    blocking a competing company from checking in code it needs.
    Any actions that treat the open-source project as if it were a
    proprietary effort owned by your company destroys the
    community's trust in your company--both for your project and
    also for any other open-source projects that your company is
    involved in. People who think that they can get good PR for an
    open-source project while playing the same old proprietary game
    are sadly mistaken. If someone tries to avoid, ignore, or
    otherwise fool your project's community, you need to point out
    that your company has made a public commitment to your
    open-source community and any monkey business will get your
    company bad publicity. Any activity that does not show respect
    to the community and the approved community processes should be
    avoided, even when apparently done with good intentions.</p>

    <p>Tension between the proprietary side of your company and
    your open-source project is apt to arise over your project's
    schedule. Groups doing proprietary efforts within your company
    expect you to have control over when your project does a
    release and what features are included in it. If their products
    depend on yours, this may cause them to make unrealistic plans.
    You need to educate them so that they understand that your
    community has a major say in the release process.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="community-issues">
    <h2>Community Issues</h2>

    <p>So far we have discussed some of the worst mistakes that can
    hurt the growth of your project's community. These include
    mistakes such as continuing to work in a proprietary style
    without engaging the community, trying to plan out the entire
    community ahead of time rather than letting it develop more
    organically, starting up the project website and mailing lists
    before you are ready to participate, and acting as if you owned
    the entire project.</p>

    <p>Another set of mistakes stems from a belief that the
    community will arise by itself. That will never happen. For
    example, it is common to believe that the community doesn't
    need face-to-face meetings--that email communication alone will
    create the needed connections between people. This just isn't
    the case. Meeting in person allows folks to put faces with
    names and to see each other as people; it helps to break down
    the barriers between your company's employees and outside
    contributors. A related mistake is believing that all that is
    needed to have a community meeting is to announce it a few
    months in advance, and then it will just happen. This also
    doesn't work. As for any meeting, it is important to plan out
    what topics will be discussed and to post an agenda well in
    advance. It is also necessary to talk up the meeting in
    community discussions. People need to be motivated to want to
    attend, especially for the first few meetings when the
    community is just getting established. Creating a vibrant
    community can occur only if you and your team nurture it by
    encouraging contributors, holding community meetings, and
    supporting community activities.</p>

    <p>Another problem occurs when your company's developers send
    harsh or acrimonious messages--<em>flames</em> --to a project
    mailing list. Flaming rarely improves matters, and the
    community will consider the flame to have come from your
    company. Make sure you and your teammates follow good posting
    etiquette and avoid attacking outside developers. Even if you
    know that the person you want to flame is comfortable with that
    sort of exchange, remember that public messages are seen by all
    the community members, many of whom do not appreciate flames.
    You should think of the entire mailing list as being the
    audience for any emails you send--don't focus on a specific
    individual. Because the mailing lists are the major way people
    in your community communicate, it is crucial that everyone
    feels safe posting to them. Flaming and harsh criticism in
    messages discourage many people from participating.</p>

    <p>A similar problem is that any opinions or comments posted by
    an employee of your company will often be taken as official
    company policy. You need to be sure to indicate which postings
    are just your personal thoughts and which are really company
    policy.</p>

    <p>Not telling the rest of the community what you are planning
    is another all too common problem. For a project that you are
    leading, this behavior will generally discourage community
    involvement; for a project that you are only a participant in,
    it will make it harder for you to get your contributions
    accepted. In both cases, you also lose out by not getting
    feedback early on when it can do the most good--so your
    eventual result will not be as good as it could have been. You
    may be acting with the best of intentions, but others in the
    community will not know that and are likely to assume
    otherwise. The article reproduced in Appendix D gives an
    example of what can happen when a company's developers do not
    communicate their plans to the community in advance.</p>

    <p>Another set of problems center on how easy it is for
    community members to create new subprojects for modules they
    are working on. On Jini.org, any registered community member
    can create a new subproject; however, old subprojects that die
    are not cleaned up. As a result, it is very confusing to Jini
    developers who want to join an existing subproject because they
    are confronted with a list of over 100 subprojects, many of
    which are defunct. For any open-source project, someone in the
    community needs to be responsible for pruning inactive
    subprojects. On the other hand, diversity is good--it's how
    innovation and creativity come about. So it's good when many
    subprojects get started, even if many of them die out. And when
    a subproject is dead, it should be moved to an inactive list
    rather than to the dumpster in case someone later wishes to
    pick it up.</p>

    <p>Evangelize active projects so potential participants know
    about them. Both the Jini and the JXTA project home web pages
    have a section spotlighting one or two community projects.</p>

    <p>The opposite problem occurs when it is too hard for someone
    to start up a new project. Both NetBeans and JXTA have an
    approval process for creating a new project. A public
    discussion is required before a new project can be approved.
    This works to avoid duplication and to inform the rest of the
    community about the new project, but in a way this may prevent
    some types of projects from being started. People are generally
    conservative, and, when a project sounds like it is outside
    what is normal or usual, people tend to discount or discredit
    it. So, if you ask people what they think about a project that
    is innovative in some way, they may tend to disparage it. In
    contrast, if you simply let the project proceed, then once
    people try out a working version of it perhaps they will
    understand its value. That is, a deliberate approval process
    can screen out innovative projects because of a kind of fear.
    Many technical people, particularly software people, try to
    create tidy logical structures and ontologies and then place
    things into them. When an area is not thoroughly known, it
    isn't possible to make such tidy structures, but that doesn't
    inhibit the impulse. Some new projects won't fit into one of
    these imagined tidy structures and might be criticized because
    of it. Hence, a better approach might be to allow anyone to
    create a new project and then have a community coordinator
    monitor the project's health; should it die, the community
    coordinator can then move it to a list of inactive
    projects.</p>

    <p>A final community-related problem concerns one-size-fits-all
    project infrastructure tools. Make sure that the company
    providing the infrastructure for your project (website, CVS
    tree, mailing lists, and bug database) does not treat your
    project as a generic open-source project. Every open-source
    project will naturally do things slightly differently, and,
    where this is significant, you don't want your project
    constrained by your infrastructure provider. For example, the
    NetBeans project had decided to use a model where any developer
    trusted to commit changes to one module was trusted to commit
    changes to every module. This model encourages community
    members to trust each other, and relies on social rather than
    technological means to enforce rules for code changes. The
    original open-source infrastructure provided by CollabNet, the
    NetBeans infrastructure provider, had supported this model.
    CollabNet later decided to upgrade their infrastructure, and
    the new design (SourceCast) assumed as universal the practice
    some open-source projects adopted of limiting developers' CVS
    access to just those modules that they have been explicitly
    granted access to. The NetBeans project discovered this only
    after the upgrade, and it caused some ruffled feathers in the
    community when developers' privileges disappeared without
    warning. CollabNet agreed to change their software to be more
    policy neutral. This example illustrates two things:
    technological concerns should not dominate design; and there is
    not one true way to do open source.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="lack-of-resources">
    <h2>Lack of Resources</h2>

    <p>The underlying cause of a number of the mistakes we have
    been discussing is a lack of resources, most notably people to
    work on some necessary aspect of your project. These people can
    be employees of your company who are assigned to work on your
    project, or they can be volunteers, including employees of
    other companies.</p>

    <p>Many projects do not have anyone assigned to be a community
    manager or coordinator. That can compound any resource problems
    because the community coordinator is the person who recruits
    volunteers from the community to help out. For a smaller
    project, this can be done by the project owner, whereas for
    bigger projects, it might be part of the product manager's job.
    For large projects, it can become a full-time job.</p>

    <p>The most common reason a project's website becomes stale is
    that no one has time to update it. Outside contributions can
    get ignored when module owners are too busy. Someone needs to
    write the internal documentation needed to orient potential
    contributors. Make sure that you don't let critical tasks
    remain undone: Assign an employee of your company or find an
    outside volunteer.</p>

    <p>One of the primary reasons to do an open-source project is
    to benefit from feedback from outside your company. If you do
    not have the resources to take advantage of this community
    feedback, then you are missing out on a major opportunity. Many
    company-sponsored open-source projects suffer from this problem
    by having inflexible plans made without consulting their
    communities. In addition to not acting on the good ideas
    suggested by your community members, you alienate them by
    ignoring what they are trying to tell you. They will stop
    wasting their time trying to interact with you and devote their
    energy elsewhere.</p>

    <p>A related problem is using the wrong resources. An
    open-source project is a development effort that exploits
    continuous design but with further opportunities for
    marketing-related and other strategic efforts. Nevertheless,
    the heart of the activity is development with development goals
    and practices. Things can go wrong if an organization other
    than engineering or development is the home for open-source
    projects and open-source oversight. For example, sometimes a
    company will determine that it needs to build a community of
    developers for some strategic purpose such as executing on a
    &quot;developer capture&quot; program designed to lure more
    developers into the company's camp. Because this is a marketing
    activity, it might seem natural to locate oversight in a
    marketing group, so that, for example, measurements of progress
    and of the nature of the developers captured can be made.
    However, a marketing group is unlikely to know enough about
    software development to oversee the community, nor is it likely
    to have a reason to care about ongoing software development
    once the developers have been &quot;captured.&quot;</p>

    <h2>Recovering from Mistakes</h2>

    <p>Everyone makes mistakes. It's what you do after a mistake
    that really matters. Here's what you need to do:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Admit that a mistake was made.</li>

      <li>Take steps to set things right.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Honestly discussing with the community what happened and how
    to make sure it does not happen again is the only way to
    proceed if you want to have a successful open-source project.
    Doing the right thing will give your community a reason to
    trust you more in the future. Being defensive, refusing to
    admit there is a problem, and refusing to fix things are just
    further mistakes that will alienate potential users and
    contributors and erode their trust in you.</p>

      <p>Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer called Linux a
      &quot;cancer&quot; because of its use of GPL, in an interview
      in the <em>Chicago Sun Times</em> on June 1, 2001.
      Microsoft's operating systems chief Jim Allchin said the
      following in a statement originally reported by <em>Bloomberg
      News</em> on February 14, 2001: &quot;I'm an American; I
      believe in the American way ... I worry if the government
      encourages open source, and I don't think we've done enough
      education of policymakers to understand the threat.&quot; One

      <p>This is in contrast to the case in the commercial world,
      where the first to market is rarely the winner (<a href=
      "IHE-23.html#59733">Creativity</a> in Chapter 2). Unlike in
      the commercial world, the open-source community tends to
      perform relentless and continuous design and redesign,
      thereby quickly turning a possibly flawed first attempt into
      a polished winner. <a href="#fnref4" class="footnoteBackLink"

      <p>&quot;Tar&quot; stands for tape archive. Originally the
      tar program was used to store files in archives on magnetic
      tape, but the modern generalization of it can create a single
      file that holds both files and directories, which is
      convenient for emailing, uploading, and downloading source
      code files for an entire system or large program. Such files
      are called &quot;tar files&quot; or, more properly, &quot;tar
      archives&quot;; a colorful variant is &quot;tarball.&quot;
