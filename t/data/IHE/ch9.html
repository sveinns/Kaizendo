    <h1>9. What To Avoid--Known Problems and Failures</h1>

    <p>As you work to move your project forward, it is inevitable
    that you will make some mistakes. How you respond to them can
    be critical to your project's success. If you are honest with
    your community about what was done and take steps to correct
    matters, then your project can move forward with strengthened
    mutual respect between you and your community. If you refuse to
    admit that there is a problem or ignore the wishes of your
    community members, then they will have less trust in you and
    your intentions. This is especially critical for large
    companies, because outside developers often start off with a
    low level of trust concerning the company's motives. Any act
    that reinforces their fears hurts your project's chances of
    success. When your actions demonstrate your respect for your
    community members' opinions, you earn their trust and improve
    the chances of your project recovering from any future
    problems.</p>

    <p>In this section, we look at some problems that can cause
    open-source projects to stumble. We hope that by being aware of
    them you can avoid them in your project.</p>

    <div id="not-understanding-open-source">
      <h2>Not Understanding Open Source</h2>

      <p>The first problems can arise when people making decisions
      about whether to use open source for a project do not
      understand how open source works. A typical failure is for
      decision makers to not believe the philosophical tenets of
      open source (see <sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id=
      "fnref1" name="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>

      <p>The reality is that even under a strong open-source
      license such as the GPL only the actual source code of the
      application is affected. Other open-source licenses, such as
      the LGPL, Mozilla, and BSD, make it easy to combine
      proprietary and open-source code. There are real issues about
      what IP an open-source project will share, but they are not
      as horrific or all-devouring as people uninformed on the
      details of open source might fear. Note that because
      open-source licenses have yet to be thoroughly tested in
      court, lawyers are prone to be overly cautious when they
      first read an open-source license.</p>

      <p>Many people believe that the point of doing open source is
      to get hundreds of outside developers to work for them for
      free. When this doesn't happen--and it almost certainly
      won't--they declare the project a failure. Moreover, managers
      who believe that open source is just a way to cut costs may
      not allocate sufficient resources to the project--starving it
      to death.</p>

      <p>A related misconception is that you will get hundreds of
      developers contributing lots of random low-quality code that
      you will somehow need to deal with. This just doesn't happen.
      If you are lucky, you might get a number of outside
      developers experimenting with your source code trying to fix
      bugs or make improvements, but you will never hear from most
      of them. Like most people, developers do not want to appear
      foolish in a public forum. If they think that their potential
      contributions are not so great, they will most likely never
      show them to anyone. In fact, your problem is more apt to be
      the opposite: trying to convince potential contributors to
      submit code that they feel is less than perfect.</p>

      <p>A common mistake is believing that a company can open
      source a project to get good PR while playing the same old
      proprietary game. The outside world will quickly see this for
      the sham it is, and no one will join the project. Doing an
      open-source project for the wrong reasons will probably get
      you a lot of bad press coverage and alienate outside
      developers.</p>

      <p>A different type of problem is starting to occur as more
      people learn about open source: People sometimes believe that
      any open-source project they create must work exactly the
      same way as an existing open-source project. Projects such as
      Apache, Mozilla, and Linux are being held up as exemplars of
      the only way to run an open-source project. Although it is
      important to learn from successful open-source projects, we
      are still just beginning to understand the landscape of open
      source. To succeed requires adopting an open-source attitude
      and innovating new ways to do things.</p>

      <p>Another mistake is not understanding that starting an
      open-source project is like launching a new product. They
      have similar life-cycle issues, the most important being that
      neither can be ended abruptly without upsetting your
      customers, which includes the community in the case of an
      open-source project. Open-source projects, like products,
      require an end-of-life plan. For more details, please refer
      to the section on <a href="IHE-56.html#92889">Ending an
      Open-Source Project</a> in Chapter 6.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="dont-needlessly-duplicate-an-existing-effort">
      <h2>Don't Needlessly Duplicate an Existing Effort</h2>

      <p>In pure voluntary open source, there generally will be
      only one open-source project in a given area. Innovation and
      invention are still possible, but the open-source philosophy
      is, as much as possible, to resist diversity and instead to
      press forward with a single solution with maximum effort. The
      few instances where there are two open-source projects trying
      to produce similar results are due to political issues: GNOME
      happened because of unhappiness with the license used by KDE,
      XEmacs came about because of a disagreement over how to add
      display support to Emacs, and Linux started up while AT&amp;T
      was battling legally with Berkeley over BSD.</p>

      <p>There are only so many open-source developers interested
      in a given area, and it is hard enough to create one
      community of them, let alone two. So if there is already an
      open-source project with goals similar to yours, then you
      should endeavor to join that project. If there is some very
      good reason why you cannot join with them--and it had better
      be an extremely compelling reason, such as they are using GPL
      and your business aim is to produce a proprietary
      version--then you should rethink whether you should be doing
      open source at all.</p>

      <p>Sometimes diversity is what's needed. If you decide to
      start a project building something with the same basic intent
      as an existing open-source project, you need to understand
      that you will get fewer volunteers and that the differences
      must be clear and distinct. Over time, you might convince
      people that your differences are worthwhile and thereby
      attract more developers and users; and over the very long run
      you might be in a position to merge back with the original
      open-source project once the relative importance and
      attractiveness of the different design and implementation
      decisions become clear through use.</p>

      <p>The story of XEmacs is illustrative here because it is
      perhaps the first instance of a commercial company working on
      free or open source as part of a business strategy, and it
      was also probably the first and most visible fork of an open
      code base.</p>

      <p>In 1991, a company named Lucid, Inc.,<sup><a href="#fn2"
      class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2" name="fnref2">2</a></sup> was
      working on a product called Energize, which was an integrated
      development environment (IDE) for C and C++ on Unix. The
      design of this development environment involved very tight
      integration among the various tools: compilers, linkers,
      debuggers, graphers, and editors. The IDE needed a powerful
      editor to tie the whole thing together, and the Lucid
      designers chose Emacs. Moreover, the IDE was graphics based:
      It assumed a window system such as X rather than the
      character-oriented terminals of the day.</p>

      <p>The then-current version of GNU Emacs from the Free
      Software Foundation was Emacs 18, which was a terminal-based
      editor relying on simple character placement for its visual
      display rather than on a graphics-based environment, which is
      standard today. At the time, there was another version of GNU
      Emacs called Epoch that had been developed at NCSA; this was
      a set of patches to Emacs 18 that gave it much better GUI
      support.</p>

      <p>Also at that time, the next major release of Emacs, Emacs
      19, was expected to integrate features from Epoch, but was
      long overdue. The Epoch maintainers themselves saw Epoch as
      an interim measure, awaiting the release of Emacs 19.</p>

      <p>The developers at Lucid didn't want to tie themselves to
      the soon-to-be-obsolete Emacs 18 or to Epoch because those
      code bases were considered obsolete even by their
      maintainers. The Lucid developers wanted to use Emacs 19; the
      idea was that Energize would operate with the off-the-shelf
      version of Emacs 19, which most people would already have
      installed on their system anyway. In that way, Energize would
      make use, to some extent, of tools developers already had and
      were already using.</p>

      <p>But because Emacs 19 wasn't done yet, Lucid decided to
      provide funding and resources to help get Emacs 19 finished.
      Many of the Lucid developers were fans of the Free Software
      Foundation and contributed to free software projects, so all
      their work on Emacs 19 was released under GPL, and they
      assigned copyright on all their work back to the Free
      Software Foundation. Lucid had no proprietary interest in
      Emacs per se--it was simply a tool that would enhance the
      value of their proprietary product, and they hoped there
      would be good PR associated with releasing the GUI-based
      Emacs when Emacs 19 had been delayed so long. Among the other
      work Lucid did for Emacs was to produce a user manual, which
      would be required for the proprietary product.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, the relationship with the Free Software
      Foundation broke down, primarily for two reasons:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>There was a dispute over the design of a hypertextlike
        addition to Emacs.</li>

        <li>There was a dispute about how display and redisplay
        could best be done on window systems such as X.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Moreover, the Free Software Foundation was not in a
      position to work as quickly as Lucid needed, so Lucid bundled
      its work into what became Lucid Emacs and released it as a
      GPLed open-source editor.</p>

      <p>After Lucid went out of business in 1994 (for unrelated
      reasons), Lucid Emacs became XEmacs. To this day, XEmacs is
      about as popular as FSF Emacs because it still provides
      features and a design that many people find superior to the
      FSF's version.</p>

      <p>As of fall 2003, the XEmacs project was looking at merging
      back into FSF Emacs, but there were still too many
      irreconcilable differences in the way the two projects viewed
      technical, programming, design, and organizational matters to
      make a merge possible. Although some commentators consider
      XEmacs to have been a divisive fork, others consider the
      competition between the two groups as positive for the rapid
      advancement of Emacs over the last decade.</p>

      <p>If you decide to start a competing project it is very
      important that you establish good relations with the
      developers of the existing project. The last thing you want
      is to have them bad-mouthing your project on forums such as
      Slashdot. Also, you probably share many common goals with
      them and there are apt to be many subprojects you can work on
      together, such as establishing common file formats.</p>

      <p>There will sometimes be cases where creating a competing
      open-source effort cannot be avoided. For example, when Sun
      released their StarOffice code as OpenOffice it overlapped
      with two existing open-source projects: Gnumerics and
      AbiWord. StarOffice was an existing proprietary office suite
      built to compete with Microsoft office. The lead developer
      for Gnumerics had been engaged in conversations with Sun
      about this overlap before OpenOffice was announced, and, as a
      result, he viewed the OpenOffice project in a good light and
      was receptive to working with Sun. However, no one on the
      AbiWord project was consulted before or after the OpenOffice
      announcement; worse, one of the AbiWord developers tried to
      start a discussion on one of the OpenOffice mailing lists
      about developing a common XML file format, but never received
      any replies from the StarOffice engineers. The result was
      that the AbiWord developers became suspicious of Sun's
      motives and did not work with Sun, and both efforts are the
      worse because of this.</p>

      <p>One final point about creating a competing open-source
      project: Do not expect any people working on existing
      projects to switch to your project. Your outside contributors
      will come from people who have not yet gotten involved with
      either project, and you will be in direct competition with
      the other project for potential new developers. In the
      OpenOffice example, none of the Gnumerics or AbiWord
      developers switched over to work on OpenOffice.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="licensing-issues">
      <h2>Licensing Issues</h2>

      <p>The license you choose can create problems if it is
      unfamiliar to your target audience or inappropriate for your
      project.</p>

      <p>It is a bad idea to create a new license for your project.
      There is a set of existing, mature open-source licenses that
      open-source developers are familiar with, and it is unlikely
      that your concerns are not addressed by one of them. If
      people are unfamiliar with a license they tend to be
      suspicious of it and shy away from the project. When Sun
      first introduced the Sun Community Source License (SCSL), no
      one quite knew what to make of it; it was also hard to
      understand. Using a new license requires taking on a large
      community education effort--time that might be better spent
      working on your project.</p>

      <p>The Mozilla project has decided that it wants to be able
      to engage more with a number of projects that use the GPL. As
      a result, it is in the messy process of contacting all the
      people who have ever contributed code to Mozilla to get their
      permission to multiply license the code under MPL, GPL, and
      LGPL. This highlights two problems: how letting contributors
      hold the copyright for their contribution prevents changing
      licensing terms and how the choice of license can limit who
      will work on the code.</p>

      <p>Beware of trying to change either the license or the
      contributor agreement after your project is underway.
      Sometimes doing this is no problem; for example, OpenOffice
      changed from requiring contributors to assign copyright of
      their submissions to Sun to requiring contributors to sign a
      joint copyright agreement (JCA), which gave contributors more
      rights and was accepted by the community almost without
      comment. However, when the NetBeans project, which had not
      previously required copyright assignment, announced it was
      adopting the same joint copyright requirement for
      contributors, several community members complained that Sun
      was acting unfairly, because it took away the right of
      exclusive ownership. Had NetBeans started with a JCA, it is
      likely that the issue would never have arisen. Part of the
      problem with almost any change you make is that it will act
      as a lightning rod, opening the door to larger-scale
      criticism if your community has major unresolved issues with
      the way you are leading the project.</p>

      <p>In general, when a company sponsoring an open-source
      project decides to make a major change to the license, the
      code, the architecture, the community, or anything else
      visible and important, the outside community will tend to
      view such decisions with suspicion. It will wonder whether
      there is some hidden, sinister reason for the change that is
      not decipherable and hence represents a trap. Therefore, make
      changes with care and involve the community as early as
      possible in discussions about important changes.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="design-issues">
      <h2>Design Issues</h2>

      <p>Earlier we have mentioned that low-code quality can be an
      issue. Similarly, a poor or otherwise deficient system design
      can lead to less success than could be hoped for. In large
      part, successful open-source projects have been either copies
      of good designs (Linux, for example) or have been designed by
      extraordinary designers. In some cases, their work had
      already been proven in the form of a series of excellent
      designs, and in others they were new talents in the
      making.</p>

      <p>A company should think carefully about how good a design
      it is thinking of offering as an open-source project. In most
      cases, a company should offer software designed by proven
      designers or else do a careful design review before releasing
      the code, followed by revisions if needed.</p>

      <p>An interesting but complex example of this is NetBeans
      versus Eclipse--this illustrates the design quality issue and
      also the first-mover myth. NetBeans started as a student
      project (originally called Xelfi) in the Czech Republic in
      1996. The goal was to write a Delphi-like Java IDE in Java. A
      company was formed around this project, called NetBeans. Sun
      acquired the company in 1999 and soon thereafter open sourced
      the code. Eclipse was designed and initially implemented by
      OTI, a Canadian company that had previously been acquired by
      IBM. OTI had extensive experience developing programming
      environments. Eclipse was released as open source several
      years after NetBeans.</p>

      <p>The two designs differ dramatically in maturity and
      quality. Part of this has to do with the experience levels of
      the two design groups, but some has to do with when the
      designs were done and the different knowledge levels--1996
      versus 2000 and students versus older professionals. The
      later Eclipse design has a sophisticated but easy-to-handle
      plug-in architecture with XML manifests, which reflected the
      growing use of XML that was apparent to OTI but hidden in the
      future for the NetBeans student team.</p>

      <p>At this point (spring 2004), Eclipse is regarded as
      superior and has more mind- and market share, but NetBeans
      has a considerable following and is making design and
      architecture changes. Nevertheless, any company would be wise
      to be sure of the quality and maturity of a design before
      releasing it.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="code-issues">
      <h2>Code Issues</h2>

      <p>One of the first hurdles an open-source project faces is
      whether the code is complete and builds a working
      application. The classic complaint about Mozilla in its early
      days was that the source code Netscape released was
      incomplete and could not make a working web browser. The
      Mozilla team was committed to the work, so the project
      continued. Once a working browser began to emerge, more
      casual contributors have also been able to participate.</p>

      <p>This is also a common problem for small projects that are
      started because someone has a cool idea: A group of people
      may exchange messages about the idea and suggest ways to
      improve it, but somehow no one ever gets around to writing
      any code! Remember that open source only works to
      incrementally improve what's there--if you have only design
      ideas, then that's what the community will improve. Someone
      needs to write the code for a minimal but working version
      before the community will contribute any code.</p>

      <p>A second hurdle is making sure that the user succeeds when
      trying out your application for the first time. This was a
      noticeable problem with Jini, not because of a problem with
      the Jini code but rather because of a problem configuring
      Windows systems to properly support multicasting. The lesson
      here is that even though your code is fine, problems with
      other software may cause your project to suffer. You need to
      go to some lengths to anticipate initial usage patterns and
      skill levels of the users when code is released to the
      community. In the Jini case, it was expected that mostly
      Solaris users would try out Jini and that any Windows users
      would be able to figure out how to configure multicast
      properly. This expectation proved to be false on both
      counts.</p>

      <p>Another stumbling block occurs when outside developers
      have trouble navigating the source code. This could be
      because the code is too difficult to understand (in which
      case it should be rewritten), there is inadequate system
      documentation, or the code base is too large. Developers who
      want to work on the OpenOffice project have a steep learning
      curve due to the tremendous amount of code involved. This is
      a particularly common problem as a project moves from being
      proprietary to open source because of the vastly different
      levels of developer involvement--even an incredibly
      well-documented proprietary project still assumes a full-time
      commitment from a new developer.</p>

      <p>Marc Fleury and Juha Lindfors wrote in "Enabling Component
      Architectures with JMX" about how modularity increased
      open-source productivity in the JBoss project:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Modularity in open source is not just a good idea.
        Modularity is the only way a project can mature. Successful
        open source projects are usually measured by the number of
        people that participate in the development. It is common
        for very successful teams to have a tightly knit core team
        of developers working on core functionality, but the key to
        growing the codebase is to enable lots of developers to
        work on modules around the core.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>JBoss 1.0 was near completion when the core developers
        came to a simple conclusion: it was too hard for the casual
        developer to come in and contribute over the course of a
        week. One would have to spend at least a week to understand
        the code before making any contribution. The situation was
        typical of second generation open source projects: lots of
        people wanted to participate but very few could actually do
        so.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <p>For the third iteration, JBoss embraced JMX. Within a
        week, an alternate SOAP-based invocation layer was
        submitted to the JBoss group. Modularity is needed for open
        source development and management. JMX is a natural way to
        enforce modularity in a design. The increased productivity
        and the ease of component integration to the server has
        made JBoss and JMX a success.<sup><a href="#fn3" class=
        "footnoteRef" id="fnref3" name="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>A related problem cropped up in the JXTA project. The JXTA
      source code was deliberately released early so that the
      community could help design it. This led to some developers
      being confused about which aspects of JXTA were not yet
      defined and which had just not been documented yet. Once
      adequate documentation was written that made this clear, the
      discussion was able to move forward smoothly.</p>

      <p>A different type of problem can happen when a project has
      a slow release cycle. One way that the outside world judges
      how well a project is doing is by how long it has been since
      the last release. If a project goes too long without a
      release, people will start to consider the project dead or a
      failure. For example, many people thought that the Mozilla
      project was in trouble after its first year because no
      working browser had been released. The frequent releases
      starting in mid-2001, leading up to version 1.0 in June 2002
      and continuing since, have dispelled this feeling and now
      people outside of the Mozilla project have good evidence that
      it is alive and making progress.</p>

      <p>If your project has not released anything for a long time,
      you should consider putting less into your next release and
      trying to do smaller, more frequent releases. You should also
      make sure that your project website is updated regularly--a
      stale website is another indication of a dying or dead
      project.</p>

      <p>Another potential problem relates to subprojects. As we
      discussed in the earlier section <sup><a href="#fn4" class=
      "footnoteRef" id="fnref4" name="fnref4">4</a></sup> For
      example, as part of the Apache XML Project, the Xerces XML
      parser appeared first making it difficult for another XML
      parser, the Crimson subproject, to be adopted. In fact, the
      best parts of Crimson have been merged into the Xerces code
      base and work on the Crimson subproject has been halted.</p>

      <p>A problem comes from believing that developing the code is
      all that is required. If all of your attention is on
      developing the code, you are likely to lose track of your
      main business goals. For example, if ubiquity is a goal, then
      marketing the technology to potential partners should have a
      high priority--internal development resources should be
      focused on helping partners succeed. If you can get a large
      company such as IBM or HP to adopt the technology, you can be
      sure they will contribute their own developers to help work
      on the code. Unfortunately, the natural tendency is to try to
      do everything yourself, and so larger opportunities are often
      neglected.</p>

      <p>Another way this problem can hurt your project is if the
      developers, both internal and external, are the only ones to
      decide on the project's future direction. The whole idea of
      open source as a meritocracy focused on coding tends to
      disenfranchise anyone who does not contribute code, which
      means that users, UI designers, marketing people, and the
      like are often not able to fully participate. This results in
      software that is designed by developers for developers, and
      this is why much open-source software is not appropriate for
      the general public. If you are seeking "world domination,"
      then this can be a major problem that you need to
      overcome.</p>

      <p>One way to make the focus go beyond the code is to
      actively make roles for nondevelopers such as UI designers
      and documentation writers. For example, NetBeans has a
      communitywide mailing list dedicated to the design and
      discussion of UI issues. There is also a NetBeans project
      focusing on UI development and issues, plus a process through
      which other developers can get UI design assistance from the
      members of the UI project. When the NetBeans project first
      started, there was a hesitancy to add nondeveloper roles like
      this because that wasn't something that the high-profile
      open-source projects such as Apache or Linux did. You may
      encounter similar resistance.</p>

      <p>It should be noted that the UI community traditionally has
      worked in a test-first design atmosphere in which usability
      testing takes place before committing anything to code, so
      there could be a basic mismatch of working styles between
      your UI folks and the open-source developers. This has been
      known to hurt open-source projects in general, so you should
      make sure that the UI folks you include in your open-source
      project are educated in continuous (re)design and buy into
      the approach.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="trying-to-control-too-much">
      <h2>Trying to Control Too Much</h2>

      <p>One of the surest ways to cripple an open-source project
      is for the original developers to refuse to give up control.
      At best this turns potential outside developers into a user
      group, and at worst it kills the project. There are many ways
      that the original developers can try to keep control.</p>

      <p>A common mistake is that the internal development group
      believes that it does not need to change how it works. Very
      often the internal developers continue to use a private
      company mailing list to carry on discussions about project
      issues. Although not every email message needs to be sent to
      the public project mailing list, if essential design
      discussions are carried out in private, then one of the main
      benefits of open source--feedback from users and outside
      developers--is lost. A further problem is that when the
      internal developers do post to the rest of the community,
      they are announcing what they have decided rather than
      starting a community discussion. For a successful open-source
      project, the internal development team needs to shift its
      email discussions to the project's public mailing lists.</p>

      <p>The other major way that internal developers keep control
      of the development process is by keeping a private code
      archive, often one that relies on a proprietary code
      versioning tool instead of CVS. Some projects do not even
      have a public code archive, just tar<sup><a href="#fn5"
      class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5" name="fnref5">5</a></sup>
      files with the source code for the most recent release. This
      sends a clear message to potential outside developers that
      they are second-class citizens who can look at the code but
      never touch it meaningfully--in fact they cannot even see the
      most recent changes but need to wait until the public copy is
      updated. A real open-source project has one public code
      archive that all developers use, although not everyone will
      have full write-access to it.</p>

      <p>Another problem arises when developers want their design
      or code to be perfect before letting anyone else see it. A
      major shift in attitude is needed to go from a proprietary
      development environment where, in many cases, no one ever
      looks at your code, to an open-source world where everyone
      may see what you've done, warts and all. Whether it's a
      single developer or the entire internal development team,
      waiting too long before releasing a design or code is a
      mistake that hurts the overall project. It is important that
      everyone thinks in terms of a work in progress, developed in
      the open to maximize possible feedback from others. Remind
      folks that nothing is final; it is always subject to
      modification as the project's needs change.</p>

      <p>A more general problem is common to both proprietary and
      open-source projects: developers and managers try to make a
      master plan and then carry it out. Planning is good, but,
      carried to the extreme of not adapting to change, it can hurt
      your project. For example, some open-source projects try to
      figure out all the appropriate mailing lists and set them up
      so they will be ready when the project is first announced.
      Unfortunately, the needs of a project that has just started
      up are often quite different from those of one that has been
      running for a while. A better approach is to start with one
      or two main mailing lists and to create more lists only when
      the number of daily messages grows too large. Engineering in
      general often tries to do the "right thing" in one step
      rather than taking a number of smaller steps in whatever
      direction currently seems best. A decision maker who believes
      strongly in master planning will probably not buy into the
      fundamental philosophical tenets of open source (see
      <sup><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6" name=
      "fnref6">6</a></sup></p>

      <p>This problem can often be seen when core developers refuse
      to engage with outside developers in design discussions on
      the project's mailing lists--often the core developers don't
      even read the public mailing lists. Refusing to listen to
      community concerns hurts the project because it both kills a
      sense of community and results in developing the wrong
      product. Keep in mind that approximately half of all software
      projects fail, not for technical reasons but because they
      produce a result that does not match the needs of the target
      audience. Feedback from the community in an open-source
      project increases the probability that what is produced is
      what is wanted. Make sure you listen to what your community
      members say; they are probably right.</p>

      <p>If your community encounters difficulties in working with
      your developers because of any of these problems, then you
      should not expect much in the way of outside contributions.
      Any external developers interested in your project will
      probably work well outside the core area that your internal
      developers have laid claim to. Contributions of new plug-ins
      or new modules are possibilities; major improvements to
      existing modules are not.</p>

      <p>Even if you have been doing everything correctly, the
      community will mostly leave improvements to the core to you
      until there are visible or a significant number of outside
      developers working on core modules. That's why it is very
      important to publicize any outside developer activities or
      contributions to the core area, to break down the view that
      your company handles everything related to it. This will take
      time, so be sure that the metrics you use to measure the
      success of your project reflect this.</p>

      <p>This is not a problem just for company-sponsored projects;
      traditional open-source projects also encounter it. For
      example, in April 2003 a fork of the XFree86 project was
      started because of the feeling that the core team was
      controlling development too tightly and not listening to the
      rest of the community. Problems identified by the community
      included limited development resources (fewer contributors
      than for much smaller open-source projects), slow release
      schedules, lack of cooperation with other projects such as
      KDE and GNOME, and an opaque development process (core team
      using a private mailing list and no information available on
      the XFree86 home page on how to become an XFree86 developer).
      Part of the problem came from the way the project was
      initially structured in order to satisfy requirements of a
      contract with X.org. The rest came from not changing the
      decision-making process as the project grew. More details can
      be found in an online interview with a former XFree86 core
      team member.<sup><a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id=
      "fnref7" name="fnref7">7</a></sup></p>

      <p>The day-to-day operation of a project offers many
      opportunities to make mistakes by people trying to retain
      control. Creating a real community requires that the
      community participate in making decisions. There is no real
      community when the only developers who can check in code to
      the CVS archive work for your company, where every important
      module is owned by a developer employed by your company, or
      where the governance board consists solely of your company's
      employees. So grant outside developers the right to check in
      code as soon as possible, put an outside developer in charge
      of a module as soon as possible, and have outside developers
      on your governance board.</p>

      <p>You can alienate outside developers if your company's
      employees are automatically given check-in privileges while
      outside developers have to earn them by making good
      contributions. This is a common mistake for open-source
      projects with a core team from a single company. It is
      important that all developers be treated according to the
      same standards regardless of which company they work for.
      Sometimes new developers at your company may have made
      contributions that the outside community doesn't see because
      they have handed over their code to the module owner in
      private, so be sure to make the activity of new folks visible
      to all.</p>

      <p>Another mistake some open-source projects make is for the
      module owners to be too slow to accept outside contributions
      and check them in to the official code archive--or even
      worse, to refuse to accept them. This might be because the
      module owner is too busy to deal with any contributions from
      the community. It might also be because the module owner is
      being too controlling over what goes into the module. Part of
      the module owner's job is to maintain the quality of the
      code, but another, equally important job is to be responsive
      to the directions set by the community.</p>

      <p>If another company is contributing so much code that the
      module owner becomes a bottleneck, then it is important that
      one or more of the outside contributors be granted the right
      to also check in code. The alternatives might be that few
      will make additional contributions or, more likely, that the
      outside developers will fork the project, as happened when
      the XEmacs developers started a second open-source project to
      develop Emacs faster and in a different direction than the
      original Emacs effort.</p>

      <p>In summary, one of the worst things you can do to your
      open-source project is to try to control it too much.
      Although other mistakes you could make will slow down or
      limit your project, your keeping too much control will
      minimize outside contributions and make it likely that
      someone will fork the project. Rather than trying to control
      everything, you should provide positive leadership. If you
      set goals that the community agrees on, then everyone will be
      working together to advance the project. If you don't engage
      the community, you will lose it because everyone will stop
      trying to work with you and go elsewhere. One final point is
      that not all engineers and managers are cut out for open
      source: If they refuse to give up control, then they may do
      more harm than good for your project.</p>

      <p>Many of these problems stem from not thoroughly buying
      into the philosophy and practices of open source. If the
      development team and management will not buy into loosening
      control and valuing active community participation, you
      should abandon pushing for using an open-source methodology
      in your company.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="marketing-issues">
      <h2>Marketing Issues</h2>

      <p>A big mistake many company-initiated open-source projects
      make is not actively marketing themselves and the
      applications they are creating. No marketing means fewer
      users and fewer contributors. For a low-key effort this may
      be fine, but if you really want your project to take off,
      people need to hear about it.</p>

      <p>When they hear about it is also important. Some companies
      make a big announcement well before the project is underway
      and the code is available. This can drum up quite a bit of
      interest in the project, but if there's nothing for potential
      outside contributors to do, it can be a wasted opportunity.
      For example, in mid-July 2000, Sun announced that the
      StarOffice source code would be made available, and created a
      project website at Openoffice.org. This generated lots of
      interest and many people flocked to the Openoffice.org
      mailing lists. Unfortunately, there was no documentation
      about the soon-to-be released code, and only a few, junior
      StarOffice developers participated on the mailing lists. As a
      result, potential community members ended up spinning their
      wheels speculating about how StarOffice worked until the code
      was finally released in mid-October and more senior members
      of the StarOffice development team joined the mailing lists.
      If you were having a party at your house, you would not think
      of making your guests wait outside for hours before letting
      them in, and, if they did have to wait outside you would go
      out and welcome them, not leave them to fend for
      themselves.</p>

      <p>Big announcements that get major press coverage are great
      for your project--when they have real content and are not
      simply hype. Many marketing and PR people are trained to sell
      benefits (and never mention possible drawbacks) as part of
      making announcements, but to technical people expecting to
      hear about a down-to-earth open-source project, such selling
      can sound like hype. Many marketing and PR people do not
      consider it worthwhile to make announcements in which they
      cannot sell benefits, and so you end up having relatively
      infrequent, large announcements with long gaps between them.
      During these gaps, people might conclude that your project is
      dead because they haven't heard any recent news about it.
      This happened to the Jini project in the several-year
      interval between when the technology was first announced and
      when products based on Jini began to appear in the
      marketplace. Any new technology will have a similar interim
      period. Following a huge initial announcement with a very
      long and noticeable silence will invite people to think the
      project has failed. You should make sure that the many small
      but significant events associated with your project are
      properly communicated to the public. Frequent short mentions
      of your progress lets people know that your project is alive
      and well. An ideal way to communicate current news of your
      project is to post it on your project's website.</p>

      <p>Letting your project website become stale is a surefire
      way to make people think that your project is dead. Many
      people interested in your project never subscribe to the
      project's mailing lists--they periodically surf to your
      project's website to see what's happening. If the project's
      home page hasn't changed, they may conclude that no major
      work has been done and are less likely to check again. Make
      sure that someone is assigned to update your website on a
      regular basis.</p>

      <p>One of the worst marketing mistakes a company can make is
      failing to give proper credit for the work done by outside
      developers. For example, back in December 1999 at a large
      trade show, Sun announced the release of a Linux version of
      the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) that had been
      done in collaboration with Borland Software Corporation (at
      the time of this incident, it was named the Inprise
      Corporation; it was originally named Borland International
      Inc.). The press release failed to mention that much of the
      work that lay behind this version of J2SE had been done by
      the Linux Blackdown Porting Team, a group of open-source
      programmers devoted to Java. The open-source community was
      stung by the omission and started to lose trust in Sun. It
      turned out that this major error happened because the
      marketing person writing the press release was unaware of the
      work done by the Blackdown project. Sun immediately released
      another announcement giving proper credit to the Blackdown
      team, and the Sun engineers in charge of the Linux port
      personally apologized to the Blackdown group. Promptly
      admitting the mistake and correcting it was crucial to Sun's
      regaining trust with the open-source community.</p>
    </div>

    <div id=
    "tension-between-an-open-source-project-and-the-rest-of-your-company">
    <h2>Tension between an Open-Source Project and the Rest of Your
    Company</h2>

      <p>The Blackdown incident highlights another mistake: Sun
      failed to publicize participation by Sun engineers in the
      Blackdown work and other open-source projects. If people
      inside of Sun had known about this, then the press-release
      mistake would never have happened. Moreover, many in the
      open-source community are unaware of Sun's many contributions
      to open-source projects, which causes Sun to not receive the
      credit it has earned. According to the Orbiten Free Software
      Survey<sup><a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"
      name="fnref8">8</a></sup> done in May 2000, Sun was in fact
      ranked as the second largest contributor of code to
      open-source projects. Your company needs to let others know
      about its contributions to open-source projects to get the
      credit it deserves--but without overemphasizing or hyping its
      participation.</p>

      <p>It's not enough that everyone working on your open-source
      project interact appropriately with the outside world, you
      also have to deal with the rest of your company. If others
      inside your company do not understand why you are using open
      source and the implications of that for their work, then your
      project can run into major trouble. Open-source projects need
      different resources than proprietary ones and have different
      constraints on how they operate. If this is not understood by
      those outside your project, then they likely will work
      against you in the normal internal politics that go on inside
      every company.</p>

      <p>One mistake your open-source project can make is to fail
      to market itself within your company. Moreover, your message
      needs to have a different emphasis from the one used for
      people outside of your company. You need to communicate how
      the goals of your project help further your company's
      business goals. If you fail to do this, then your project may
      be seen as irrelevant and other, proprietary efforts will be
      given precedence. This marketing must be an ongoing activity,
      especially when there are changes in upper management.</p>

      <p>You must educate people at your company about what metrics
      will be used to measure the success of your project. These
      are likely to be quite different from the more familiar
      metrics used for proprietary projects. Anyone opposed to your
      project, for whatever reason, will have a much harder time
      proving it a failure if everyone understands the appropriate
      metrics for measuring it.</p>

      <p>The results of a lack of internal marketing and poor
      metrics can be devastating to your project if your company
      hits hard times and needs to look for people to lay off. This
      happened at Sun in 2001 when the size of the Jini development
      team was reduced. Particularly hard hit were those folks
      working on community issues, including the main community
      manager (who was also one of the original developers of Jini)
      and the person working on updating the Jini.org website.
      These were very visible cuts, and the community began to
      conclude that they signalled that Sun was pulling back from
      Jini technology. It took several messages from Sun executives
      to reassure the community that Jini was still important to
      the company.</p>

      <p>A common management mistake we have seen is to have people
      trying to serve two masters. Developers helping to grow the
      community while writing code to meet internal deadlines for
      proprietary work will feel pressure from the company to make
      the proprietary work higher priority. It is necessary to
      separate developers into those focused on the open-source
      activities of the project and those doing work on proprietary
      projects. Otherwise, local pressure from managers and
      coworkers will ensure that the proprietary aspects are given
      priority. A failure to include community-related metrics in
      the performance reviews of those involved with open-source
      activities is a common mistake, with the direct result that
      those community activities tend to be neglected.</p>

      <p>The worst type of mistake that projects make is to try to
      cheat or put something over on their communities. This could
      be as minor as sneaking code into the code base or as major
      as blocking a competing company from checking in code it
      needs. Any actions that treat the open-source project as if
      it were a proprietary effort owned by your company destroys
      the community's trust in your company--both for your project
      and also for any other open-source projects that your company
      is involved in. People who think that they can get good PR
      for an open-source project while playing the same old
      proprietary game are sadly mistaken. If someone tries to
      avoid, ignore, or otherwise fool your project's community,
      you need to point out that your company has made a public
      commitment to your open-source community and any monkey
      business will get your company bad publicity. Any activity
      that does not show respect to the community and the approved
      community processes should be avoided, even when apparently
      done with good intentions.</p>

      <p>Tension between the proprietary side of your company and
      your open-source project is apt to arise over your project's
      schedule. Groups doing proprietary efforts within your
      company expect you to have control over when your project
      does a release and what features are included in it. If their
      products depend on yours, this may cause them to make
      unrealistic plans. You need to educate them so that they
      understand that your community has a major say in the release
      process.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="community-issues">
      <h2>Community Issues</h2>

      <p>So far we have discussed some of the worst mistakes that
      can hurt the growth of your project's community. These
      include mistakes such as continuing to work in a proprietary
      style without engaging the community, trying to plan out the
      entire community ahead of time rather than letting it develop
      more organically, starting up the project website and mailing
      lists before you are ready to participate, and acting as if
      you owned the entire project.</p>

      <p>Another set of mistakes stems from a belief that the
      community will arise by itself. That will never happen. For
      example, it is common to believe that the community doesn't
      need face-to-face meetings--that email communication alone
      will create the needed connections between people. This just
      isn't the case. Meeting in person allows folks to put faces
      with names and to see each other as people; it helps to break
      down the barriers between your company's employees and
      outside contributors. A related mistake is believing that all
      that is needed to have a community meeting is to announce it
      a few months in advance, and then it will just happen. This
      also doesn't work. As for any meeting, it is important to
      plan out what topics will be discussed and to post an agenda
      well in advance. It is also necessary to talk up the meeting
      in community discussions. People need to be motivated to want
      to attend, especially for the first few meetings when the
      community is just getting established. Creating a vibrant
      community can occur only if you and your team nurture it by
      encouraging contributors, holding community meetings, and
      supporting community activities.</p>

      <p>Another problem occurs when your company's developers send
      harsh or acrimonious messages--<em>flames</em> --to a project
      mailing list. Flaming rarely improves matters, and the
      community will consider the flame to have come from your
      company. Make sure you and your teammates follow good posting
      etiquette and avoid attacking outside developers. Even if you
      know that the person you want to flame is comfortable with
      that sort of exchange, remember that public messages are seen
      by all the community members, many of whom do not appreciate
      flames. You should think of the entire mailing list as being
      the audience for any emails you send--don't focus on a
      specific individual. Because the mailing lists are the major
      way people in your community communicate, it is crucial that
      everyone feels safe posting to them. Flaming and harsh
      criticism in messages discourage many people from
      participating.</p>

      <p>A similar problem is that any opinions or comments posted
      by an employee of your company will often be taken as
      official company policy. You need to be sure to indicate
      which postings are just your personal thoughts and which are
      really company policy.</p>

      <p>Not telling the rest of the community what you are
      planning is another all too common problem. For a project
      that you are leading, this behavior will generally discourage
      community involvement; for a project that you are only a
      participant in, it will make it harder for you to get your
      contributions accepted. In both cases, you also lose out by
      not getting feedback early on when it can do the most
      good--so your eventual result will not be as good as it could
      have been. You may be acting with the best of intentions, but
      others in the community will not know that and are likely to
      assume otherwise. The article reproduced in Appendix D gives
      an example of what can happen when a company's developers do
      not communicate their plans to the community in advance.</p>

      <p>Another set of problems center on how easy it is for
      community members to create new subprojects for modules they
      are working on. On Jini.org, any registered community member
      can create a new subproject; however, old subprojects that
      die are not cleaned up. As a result, it is very confusing to
      Jini developers who want to join an existing subproject
      because they are confronted with a list of over 100
      subprojects, many of which are defunct. For any open-source
      project, someone in the community needs to be responsible for
      pruning inactive subprojects. On the other hand, diversity is
      good--it's how innovation and creativity come about. So it's
      good when many subprojects get started, even if many of them
      die out. And when a subproject is dead, it should be moved to
      an inactive list rather than to the dumpster in case someone
      later wishes to pick it up.</p>

      <p>Evangelize active projects so potential participants know
      about them. Both the Jini and the JXTA project home web pages
      have a section spotlighting one or two community
      projects.</p>

      <p>The opposite problem occurs when it is too hard for
      someone to start up a new project. Both NetBeans and JXTA
      have an approval process for creating a new project. A public
      discussion is required before a new project can be approved.
      This works to avoid duplication and to inform the rest of the
      community about the new project, but in a way this may
      prevent some types of projects from being started. People are
      generally conservative, and, when a project sounds like it is
      outside what is normal or usual, people tend to discount or
      discredit it. So, if you ask people what they think about a
      project that is innovative in some way, they may tend to
      disparage it. In contrast, if you simply let the project
      proceed, then once people try out a working version of it
      perhaps they will understand its value. That is, a deliberate
      approval process can screen out innovative projects because
      of a kind of fear. Many technical people, particularly
      software people, try to create tidy logical structures and
      ontologies and then place things into them. When an area is
      not thoroughly known, it isn't possible to make such tidy
      structures, but that doesn't inhibit the impulse. Some new
      projects won't fit into one of these imagined tidy structures
      and might be criticized because of it. Hence, a better
      approach might be to allow anyone to create a new project and
      then have a community coordinator monitor the project's
      health; should it die, the community coordinator can then
      move it to a list of inactive projects.</p>

      <p>A final community-related problem concerns
      one-size-fits-all project infrastructure tools. Make sure
      that the company providing the infrastructure for your
      project (website, CVS tree, mailing lists, and bug database)
      does not treat your project as a generic open-source project.
      Every open-source project will naturally do things slightly
      differently, and, where this is significant, you don't want
      your project constrained by your infrastructure provider. For
      example, the NetBeans project had decided to use a model
      where any developer trusted to commit changes to one module
      was trusted to commit changes to every module. This model
      encourages community members to trust each other, and relies
      on social rather than technological means to enforce rules
      for code changes. The original open-source infrastructure
      provided by CollabNet, the NetBeans infrastructure provider,
      had supported this model. CollabNet later decided to upgrade
      their infrastructure, and the new design (SourceCast) assumed
      as universal the practice some open-source projects adopted
      of limiting developers' CVS access to just those modules that
      they have been explicitly granted access to. The NetBeans
      project discovered this only after the upgrade, and it caused
      some ruffled feathers in the community when developers'
      privileges disappeared without warning. CollabNet agreed to
      change their software to be more policy neutral. This example
      illustrates two things: technological concerns should not
      dominate design; and there is not one true way to do open
      source.</p>

    <div id="lack-of-resources">
      <h2>Lack of Resources</h2>

      <p>The underlying cause of a number of the mistakes we have
      been discussing is a lack of resources, most notably people
      to work on some necessary aspect of your project. These
      people can be employees of your company who are assigned to
      work on your project, or they can be volunteers, including
      employees of other companies.</p>

      <p>Many projects do not have anyone assigned to be a
      community manager or coordinator. That can compound any
      resource problems because the community coordinator is the
      person who recruits volunteers from the community to help
      out. For a smaller project, this can be done by the project
      owner, whereas for bigger projects, it might be part of the
      product manager's job. For large projects, it can become a
      full-time job.</p>

      <p>The most common reason a project's website becomes stale
      is that no one has time to update it. Outside contributions
      can get ignored when module owners are too busy. Someone
      needs to write the internal documentation needed to orient
      potential contributors. Make sure that you don't let critical
      tasks remain undone: Assign an employee of your company or
      find an outside volunteer.</p>

      <p>One of the primary reasons to do an open-source project is
      to benefit from feedback from outside your company. If you do
      not have the resources to take advantage of this community
      feedback, then you are missing out on a major opportunity.
      Many company-sponsored open-source projects suffer from this
      problem by having inflexible plans made without consulting
      their communities. In addition to not acting on the good
      ideas suggested by your community members, you alienate them
      by ignoring what they are trying to tell you. They will stop
      wasting their time trying to interact with you and devote
      their energy elsewhere.</p>

      <p>A related problem is using the wrong resources. An
      open-source project is a development effort that exploits
      continuous design but with further opportunities for
      marketing-related and other strategic efforts. Nevertheless,
      the heart of the activity is development with development
      goals and practices. Things can go wrong if an organization
      other than engineering or development is the home for
      open-source projects and open-source oversight. For example,
      sometimes a company will determine that it needs to build a
      community of developers for some strategic purpose such as
      executing on a "developer capture" program designed to lure
      more developers into the company's camp. Because this is a
      marketing activity, it might seem natural to locate oversight
      in a marketing group, so that, for example, measurements of
      progress and of the nature of the developers captured can be
      made. However, a marketing group is unlikely to know enough
      about software development to oversee the community, nor is
      it likely to have a reason to care about ongoing software
      development once the developers have been "captured."</p>

    <div id="recovering-from-mistakes">
      <h2>Recovering from Mistakes</h2>

      <p>Everyone makes mistakes. It's what you do after a mistake
      that really matters. Here's what you need to do:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Admit that a mistake was made.</li>

        <li>Take steps to set things right.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Honestly discussing with the community what happened and
      how to make sure it does not happen again is the only way to
      proceed if you want to have a successful open-source project.
      Doing the right thing will give your community a reason to
      trust you more in the future. Being defensive, refusing to
      admit there is a problem, and refusing to fix things are just
      further mistakes that will alienate potential users and
      contributors and erode their trust in you.</p>

        <p>Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer called Linux a "cancer"
