  <h1>1. Introduction</h1>

  <p>Business is changing after the expansive thinking of the late
  1990s followed by the lessons learned in the early 2000s: It no
  longer makes sense for every company to make and own every aspect
  of its business. Many companies--perhaps all of them--require
  software, and many create software as an integral part of running
  their businesses; and some even produce software as part of their
  offerings. Every such company knows deeply that producing
  software is not a cakewalk and that the pace of creating final,
  usable software is slow. A na&iuml;ve promise of open source is
  that it is somehow free of cost. But the real opportunities of
  open source come from many directions.</p>

  <p>In fact, there are so many business and strategic reasons for
  a company heavily invested in creating software to adopt
  open-source activities that a company that does not can be
  considered to be out of touch with its own destiny. Even if a
  company decides that public (or pure, all-volunteer) open source
  is not for it, using open source within its firewalls could be a
  smart decision for pure software development methodology
  reasons.</p>

  <div id="open-source:-a-different-way-of-doing-business">
    <h2>Open Source: A Different Way of Doing Business</h2>

    <p>When businesspeople first encounter the idea of public
    open-source software, they are usually attracted by the fact
    that it is cost-free and that they get access to the underlying
    source code--open-source software is like coming across a
    blueberry bush bursting with fat ripe blueberries. But then it
    hits them that open-source software comes on an as-is basis
    with no warranty, no indemnification, and no support. No one is
    officially responsible--there is no one to contract with and no
    one to sue for liability.</p>

    <p>Also confusing is the open-source development process. Who
    is in charge? How are decisions made? What is the development
    schedule? Finally, the idea of giving work done by their
    developers away to anyone--possibly including their business
    competitors--seems to violate common sense.</p>

    <p>All in all this is not how they are used to doing business.
    But open source does make sense.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="innovation-happens-elsewhere">
    <h2>Innovation Happens Elsewhere</h2>

    <p>Companies who wish to create wealth are always interested in
    productivity. Productivity includes being able to innovate
    effectively. Effective innovation is not merely being able to
    invent and improve, but also being able to determine what to
    invent and how to improve. High productivity requires doing
    less to produce as much or more--a company that requires its
    own employees to labor hard and long to make its products or
    perform its services will be less profitable, in general, than
    one that can take advantage of the efforts of others. In most
    cases, this means that a company wishing to innovate
    productively must recognize that valuable work and talent exist
    outside the confines of the company and that it must find ways
    of using that outside material and expertise while still
    maintaining a competitive edge.</p>

    <p>Until now, the most effective way of accomplishing this has
    been to purchase a company that has a technology or product of
    interest to the buyer along with the personnel who can maintain
    and move it forward. One of the best-known examples of this was
    Turbo Pascal, one of Borland International's most successful
    products--one that helped put Borland on the map.</p>

    <p>Turbo Pascal started out as Blue Label Software (BLS)
    Pascal, developed and marketed by a company called PolyData
    based in Copenhagen, Denmark, and written primarily by Anders
    Hejlsberg. It was a subset of the full Pascal language along
    with an editor, compiler, and run-time libraries. BLS Pascal
    evolved into a complete Pascal implementation, changing its
    name to COMPAS and then PolyPascal as it moved to other
    platforms and further evolved. In 1983 PolyData entered into a
    license agreement with Borland. Borland wrote a new editor and
    menu system for PolyPascal, and the resulting product became
    Turbo Pascal. PolyPascal and Turbo Pascal were marketed in
    parallel for a few years, but thereafter PolyPascal was
    discontinued. When Anders Hejlsberg moved to the United States
    in 1987, he became a full-time employee of Borland.</p>

    <p>One of Borland's most significant innovations with
    PolyPascal was to take a product that had previously sold for
    about $500 and sell it for $49.95. At that time, fully
    professional-grade development environments including a
    language compiler sold for around $3000, and Turbo Pascal was
    of similar quality. Therefore, this price innovation had a
    dramatic effect on the market. Moreover, not only was Borland
    able to get a top-quality development tool, but it was able to
    hire a top programming-language designer and implementor. By
    not having a stake in how hard it had been to develop the
    product, Borland was able to price the package so that it would
    sell dramatically well. Few people at that time--the early
    1980s--had any idea that software developed for sale could be
    sold reasonably at commodity prices. And even after Borland
    entered the scene with Turbo Pascal, the lesson was learned
    only slowly.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, an important part of the Turbo Pascal story is
    that intellectual property rights were well defined and
    protected for both PolyData and Borland. Borland would not have
    entered into the agreement without the exclusive rights the
    agreement provided. Deciding whether to incorporate open source
    as part of a business strategy requires coming to grips with
    which property rights and control over the technology are
    important to your company.</p>

    <p>The phrase &quot;innovation happens elsewhere&quot; captures
    the essence of the idea of adding just the smallest amount of
    innovation necessary for competitive advantage. It is common
    for people working for a technology company to suffer, at least
    a little, from the belief that all the really innovative people
    in their particular technology happen to work at that company.
    This can cause such a company to work too hard to produce every
    last bit of related technology, which is often not the best
    competitive approach. Many advantages accrue when a company
    adopts the attitude that most innovation happens elsewhere and
    focuses on choosing the best outside innovations and figuring
    out the right distinguishing features to make its products
    competitive.</p>

    <p>Traditional open source is one of the best examples of this
    approach. The Internet started out as the ARPAnet, and many of
    the underlying technologies powering it--Domain Name Service
    (DNS via BIND), email transport (sendmail), and various open
    TCP/IP implementations--were developed in the public domain and
    remain open-source implementations, even when there are
    commercial versions available. Working in the public domain in
    the style of an open university research environment was the
    norm when the foundations of the Internet were being laid in
    the 1970s and early 1980s. Although there were software
    companies and software for sale, software was considered
    secondary to hardware, which made up the bulk of the purchase
    price of a computer system. Even in the late 1980s the concept
    that the software for a system might cost more than the
    hardware was laughable--the hardware is <em>real,</em> after
    all. Today it is quite common for the software costs to
    dominate the cost of a desktop computer system, and this trend
    has paralleled the rise of the software market. Open source is
    the continuation of this earlier style of software production,
    and the increase in activity in open-source projects has
    likewise mirrored the expansion of the commercial software
    segment, largely as a reaction to it.</p>

    <p>Despite their apparent political or philosophical
    tendencies, the open-source and free-software activities point
    the way toward harnessing outside innovation for companies.
    What we mean is that not only is the software produced by
    open-source projects useful for improving productivity for
    companies, but so are the open-source practices and the idea of
    companies participating in and starting open-source
    projects.</p>

    <p>By engaging an outside community, a company can learn which
    innovations to make and how to make them. All that is required
    is to play by some rules, give up the commodity part of the
    product, and skillfully retain the high-value part. In
    exchange, the community will, in general, act as a co-author of
    the company's product and innovate in unexpected ways.</p>

    <p>Open source is not simply a resource--it is a viable
    business strategy.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="jumping-in">
    <h2>Jumping In</h2>

    <p>A number of companies have jumped into open source, some of
    them basing their businesses entirely on it, such as Red Hat,
    VA Software, and CollabNet, but many more have started
    open-source projects both inside and outside their corporate
    firewalls. Among the larger or more widely known companies
    using open source as part of their business strategies are
    General Electric (GE), Sun Microsystems, IBM, Apple,
    Hewlett-Packard (HP), SGI, Oracle, Cisco, Intel, and
    Symbian.</p>

    <p>Apple is an interesting example because it is not generally
    known as embracing open source but is thought of as being a
    highly proprietary company from its earlier years. Apple's OS X
    is based on Darwin, which is an open-source project. Here is
    what Apple's developer website says about it:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Apple's open source projects allow developers to customize
      and enhance key Apple software. Through the open source
      model, Apple engineers and the open source community
      collaborate to create better, faster and more reliable
      products for our users.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Beneath the appealing, easy-to-use interface of Mac OS X
      is a rock-solid foundation that is engineered for stability,
      reliability, and performance. This foundation is a core
      operating system commonly known as Darwin. Darwin integrates
      a number of technologies, most importantly Mach 3.0,
      operating-system services based on 4.4BSD (Berkeley Software
      Distribution), high-performance networking facilities, and
      support for multiple integrated file systems.<sup><a href=
      "#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1" name=
      "fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>However, an important part of this strategy is hidden.
    Because Darwin is one of the Unix family of operating systems,
    a fair number of other open-source packages happen to work on
    the platform, which helps Apple dramatically because the
    Macintosh platform is regarded as hosting relatively few
    applications. Even though the current crop of open-source Unix
    applications is not especially appealing for businesses per se,
    they are appealing to the scientific and engineering
    communities, which are well represented in the business sector,
    and as Linux makes inroads into the server and client markets,
    the application base for OS X can only get better.</p>

    <p>For example, there is an open-source project called Fink
    dedicated to bringing some of the open-source Unix programs to
    Darwin:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The Fink project wants to bring the full world of Unix
      Open Source software to Darwin and Mac OS X. We modify Unix
      software so that it compiles and runs on Mac OS X
      (&quot;port&quot; it) and make it available for download as a
      coherent distribution.<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef"
      id="fnref2" name="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>There are currently about 3500 packages in the Fink project.
    The packages by and large are not integrated into the full Aqua
    user interface, but they do provide significant functionality
    to the platform.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="understanding-open-source">
    <h2>Understanding Open Source</h2>

    <p>Open source forms a commons where certain types of
    development take place in the open and the artifacts are
    available for general use. The primary problem software-related
    companies face at the beginning of the twenty-first century is
    how to innovate effectively. Innovation is relatively common
    and easy, but being able to choose which innovations will make
    the most business sense and then monetizing them is not easy.
    There is in general a trade-off between doing things in the
    commons, where innovation is easy because of the large number
    of diverse people and unfamiliar ideas, and doing things behind
    closed doors, where it is easy to keep a competitive advantage
    through secrecy and intellectual property laws. The first step
    is understanding innovation and creativity and how a commons
    can be a good venue for them.</p>

    <p>Open source itself seems new and is mysterious in many ways.
    Why would anyone work for free? Where did these ideas come
    from? What sorts of software are created using an open-source
    methodology? Open source seems like it comes from a mob, but in
    reality it comes from a set of communities. These communities
    are tied together through culture, vocabulary, customs,
    practices, values, ethics, and morals. Being able to work with
    an open-source community requires understanding all these
    things well enough not to be made a fool of immediately and
    then learning how to work effectively within the chosen
    community. There is an arc of maturation as you enter an
    open-source community as a newcomer or foreigner and then
    progress to becoming an inhabitant, then perhaps to leader, and
    then on to respected elder. Open source works on principles
    common to gift economies, which are generally more fundamental,
    or primitive, than free-market economies (which tend to be
    overly rational in how they treat value and compensation).
    Perhaps it's best to call gift economies precapitalistic.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless there are many business reasons to embrace open
    source, all the way from just using open-source software such
    as Linux or Apache to starting and running open-source
    projects. The reasons to engage with open source include the
    following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Getting high-quality, free software and software design
      and development help.</li>

      <li>Making your software ubiquitous through participation and
      low cost.</li>

      <li>Engaging end-users in design and testing.</li>

      <li>Reducing time to market.</li>

      <li>Doing marketing and marketing research.</li>

      <li>Working with partners who prefer a loose
      relationship.</li>

      <li>Positioning a company.</li>

      <li>Harvesting innovation.</li>

      <li>Making standards.</li>

      <li>Building a brand through ubiquity and positioning
      vis-&agrave;-vis the open-source community.</li>

      <li>Adopting transparent development processes.</li>

      <li>Changing customer and market perceptions.</li>

      <li>Making a vision pervasive.</li>

      <li>Changing the rules.</li>

      <li>Reducing support costs.</li>

      <li>Injecting discipline into the development process.</li>

      <li>Improving integration.</li>

      <li>Satisfying more customers.</li>

      <li>Porting to otherwise unimportant platforms.</li>

      <li>Avoiding lock-in.</li>

      <li>Changing pricing practices.</li>

      <li>Signing up partners and creating consortia.</li>

      <li>Creating markets.</li>

      <li>Making ethical, moral, and political statements.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All-volunteer open source is the purest form. Projects such
    as Linux and Apache, before they were noticed and embraced by
    companies, were examples of all-volunteer open source; most of
    the projects on SourceForge are also examples. When a company
    joins an open-source project and especially when a company
    starts an open-source project, it brings to the table experts
    and processes that are not usually part of open-source
    projects. These include usability experts, release management,
    quality assurance, specification writing, documentation
    writers, and project management. These other process
    appurtenances can be carried over to varying degrees, but
    inevitably they alter the all-volunteer nature of open source,
    and therefore a company needs to know about how open source
    works in order to bring these other roles and practices to the
    table effectively. This is the central topic of this book.</p>

    <p>An important legal key to open source is licensing. There is
    a pervasive myth that open-source software is not owned by
    anyone and that a company doing open source must give up
    ownership and control of its property. Actually, open source
    recognizes ownership and generally the primacy of ownership and
    its concomitant rights. Software licenses can yield many levels
    of rights because there is a vast gap between having no rights
    and all rights. Licenses can give the right to distribute and
    make changes to source code, but also can limit what sorts of
    distributions and changes are allowed. The license establishes,
    to an extent, the legal basis for an open-source project and
    community. There are a variety of licenses ranging from
    granting the right to view source, to gated communities, to
    open source, to free software, to public domain.</p>

    <p>Engaging in an open-source project requires understanding
    the community, its culture and customs, its tools, and its way
    of working. Open-source projects are distributed and work
    through email, websites, and other written documents. There are
    standard versioning tools, compilers, bug-tracking tools, and
    customs for using them. Building, testing, support, and
    releases are handled in particular ways. There is a sort of
    hierarchy to the developers centered on module owners and the
    concept of a meritocracy, where rights are expanded only after
    abilities have been demonstrated.</p>

    <p>In general, a company starting an open-source project needs
    to expend energy and resources creating a sufficiently large
    and robust community that will contribute, regardless of the
    type of contribution expected. Some managers and executives,
    upon beginning to engage in open source, are surprised that it
    seems more like a social activity than a development exercise,
    but this is the reality. To work with an open-source
    project--especially to start one up--requires an understanding
    of the culture and customs of the open-source way.</p>

    <p>Beyond figuring out the business reasons for doing open
    source, a company or project needs to look at a variety of
    issues to determine whether it makes sense to use an
    open-source approach. These include whether you and your
    management buy into the open-source lifestyle, whether the
    source code is suitable and ready for source licensing, whether
    you have the resources, and whether your resource expectations
    are reasonable. Then you have to get the source code ready, get
    the company ready, choose a license, create a development plan
    and roadmap, make a budget and get funding, educate your
    developers, and build a website. Beyond these, there are
    commonsense things to do to build the community and maintain
    credibility in the open-source community.</p>

    <p>After you've started an open-source project, there is a lot
    of work to do to keep its momentum building: It's not a matter
    of throwing the source code over a wall and watching a crowd
    gather. You need to craft and evolve the vision for the
    project, keep resources applied to the community, actively
    bring in contributors and users, evolve the website, keep
    things active and looking active, grow and mature your
    community members, and communicate transparently.</p>

    <p>There are things you need to do to succeed. You really need
    to understand and buy into the open-source lifestyle. You need
    to start a relevant and useful project, not one that duplicates
    an existing effort. You need to get your code in shape and
    choose a good license--both for the open-source community and
    for your company. If you don't seem to have a way to make money
    or other commercial gain, the open-source community may
    consider you not with-it enough to risk expending effort on
    your project. And there are things to avoid. The biggest
    mistakes you can make involve control. The one characteristic
    of companies that open-source developers despise is
    overcontrol. It is natural to want to control a project, but
    the level of control that makes sense for an open-source
    project may seem too lax for development managers and
    executives. In many ways, the development processes in open
    source seem inefficient because they are based on written
    communication, and it's easy to fall into taking shortcuts, for
    instance by making important decisions in local, face-to-face
    meetings. This can cause tensions inside and outside the
    project in your company.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the community will not arise just by itself. There
    is nurturing to do. And it's easy to buy into this concept
    intellectually while still failing to understand or appreciate
    what it means for everyday work. Most open-source communities
    need to have an email (or push-based) culture in order to seem
    vigorous and viable. Pull-type websites need to have compelling
    content for people to visit every day, and an open-source
    project is unlikely to have that.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, many companies have embraced the use of open
    source. In 2002, a study by Berlecon
    Research<em>(FLOSS--Free/Libre Open Source Software: Survey and
    Study)</em> conducted for the European Commission found that
    eight of the world's 25 largest software companies, including
    IBM, HP/Compaq, SAP, Hitachi, and Sun Microsystems, had a major
    involvement with open source and that another three companies
    engaged in lesser open-source activity. This was based on
    public announcements by the companies of their involvement, and
    so the actual use of open source is undoubtedly higher.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="communities">
    <h2>Communities</h2>

    <p>One of the hardest lessons to learn about working in open
    source is that the work involves community building, politics,
    citizenship, principles, and governance. An open-source project
    consists of some shared artifacts--source code, documentation,
    and so forth--and some mailing lists, newsgroups, and perhaps
    some other social software. That is, there are the things, on
    the one hand, and the people, on the other. The people form a
    community, a community that interacts, that forms customs and
    traditions, that develops friendships and affiliations, and
    that, in short, creates a culture. Many software developers
    ignore the social aspects of open source and might even be
    surprised, in many cases, to hear people talk of open source as
    a social or community activity. At the first Jini community
    meeting, one developer remarked, &quot;Is Jini a technology or
    a sociology experiment?&quot;</p>

    <p>For a company to succeed at open source, and more so than
    for an individual or an established open-source project, it
    must take community seriously and be explicit about it. This is
    because there is always some suspicion by outsiders that a
    company has some hidden, unpleasant agenda.</p>

    <p>Community building consists of the activities done to foster
    a culture and make it pleasant and rewarding to be a member of
    the community. There must be ways for individuals to visit the
    community, learn about it, join it as newcomers, become
    productive members, develop into experts, and finally become
    respected elders.</p>

    <p>Politics enters the scene when companies or other competing
    interests are involved. How are compromises made? How are the
    positions of established expertise respected? These are
    political questions.</p>

    <p>Citizenship has to do not only with the ways individuals
    mature through an arc of roles, but with whether individuals
    have the opportunity to feel that being a member of the
    community distinguishes them from others and whether this
    distinction is a source of pride. Perhaps the community has a
    significant name (Linux), a logo or other identifiable sign (a
    penguin), or established customs (yearly community meetings).
    Perhaps the community is known for its level of technical
    expertise or its important contributions.</p>

    <p>Principles form the backbone of any open-source project.
    Software developers and engineers are overwhelmingly principled
    and ethical,<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"
    name="fnref3">3</a></sup> so that any open-source project
    started by a company needs to embrace and make explicit its
    dedication to principles. Open-source projects started by
    individuals generally don't have to be explicit about their
    principles because such principles are so prevalent within the
    developer community. But a company does not have this
    luxury.</p>

    <p>Governance has to do with how decisions are made about the
    workings of the community. For the Linux project, Linus
    Torvalds makes many decisions about what code gets accepted
    into the source tree and who else has the authority to make
    such decisions, so he is part of the governance of the project;
    he decided that he makes such decisions. For companies,
    governance generally needs to be more explicit and, obviously,
    equitable and fair. As non-company-based open-source projects
    mature, they are finding that governance needs to be made
    explicit.</p>

    <p>A good example of the importance of community is the project
    that designed Common Lisp, which was one of the first large
    network-based design collaborations, begun in 1981. One of us
    (RPG) was the originator of the Common Lisp effort. It began in
    the summer of 1981 as a consolidation effort between
    descendents of an older dialect of Lisp called MacLisp. After a
    series of short face-to-face meetings, the bulk of the work
    shifted to an email-based discussion on the ARPAnet (the
    predecessor of the Internet). The acknowledged list of
    contributors contains 62 individuals who exchanged over 2000
    email messages over a 2-year period along with two or three
    face-to-face meetings and four drafts of the specification
    written primarily by Guy L. Steele Jr. Over its lifetime, the
    group exchanged well over 10,000 email messages.</p>

    <p>The culture of this community was central to how it worked.
    The community developed an interaction style and a particular
    online culture in which a person's participation as well as
    &quot;influence&quot; depended on his or her expertise. Keep in
    mind that at that time (1981) there were no or very few online
    communities. Network email was limited to some universities and
    Department of Defense-related companies. It turned out--as we
    know only so well today--that people are more prone to be
    insulting and forthright in email than in person. Many of the
    discussions carried on over the network were quite spirited,
    but they had the advantage of being written down. There was no
    need to rely on dim memory or pale ink because all the mail was
    automatically stored in a centralized place, so there was no
    chance of losing or misplacing it.</p>

    <p>The discussions were often in the form of proposals,
    discussions, and counterproposals for the design of Common
    Lisp. Code examples from existing software or proposed new
    syntax were often exchanged. And all was subject to quick
    review by community members. New members of the community
    wishing to come up to speed could go to the archives.</p>

    <p>This online style had some drawbacks. Foremost, it was not
    possible to observe the facial and body reactions of other
    people, to see whether some point angered them, which would
    mean the point was important to them. There was no immediate
    way to see that an argument had gone too far or had little
    support. This meant that time was wasted and that carefully
    crafted written arguments were required to get anything
    done.</p>

    <p>The leader of the group was Scott Fahlman of Carnegie-Mellon
    University, and there was an inner circle of decision
    makers--Scott Fahlman, Guy Steele, David Moon, Daniel Weinreb,
    and Richard P. Gabriel--called the Quinquevirate or Gang of
    Five. Just outside this circle was the semi-official Common
    Lisp Group, which included 33 individuals. This was its
    governance.</p>

    <p>In all, the benefits of the contentious interaction style
    characteristic of the culture outweighed its problems.
    Moreover, the expert leadership, the small core of decision
    makers, the excellent specification-writing talent, and the
    freedom to work continuously without needing to schedule
    meeting times meant that the result was quite extraordinary.
    Despite the diverse and oddball nature of the individuals, a
    definite culture emerged with strong bonds, a private language,
    emergent roles, and definite traditions.<sup><a href="#fn4"
    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4" name="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>

    <p>The Common Lisp community was based on the principles of
    openness and the celebration of technical expertise that
    characterized the MIT AI (Artificial Intelligence) Lab culture.
    This is the culture that formed and still supports the views of
    Richard Stallman, who is the founder of the Free Software
    Foundation--which kicked off the open-source movement--and who
    was an active member of the Common Lisp community.</p>

    <p>Politics was central to the community. One goal was to bring
    together Lisp machine companies that had developed new and
    different Lisp language features to distinguish themselves from
    each other and other Lisp vendors (both hardware and software
    vendors) to agree on a common standard--if it was successful,
    this standard would diminish their
    differentiators.<sup><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id=
    "fnref5" name="fnref5">5</a></sup> Moreover, software Lisp
    vendors working on general-purpose computer implementations,
    academics, and Lisp users were invited into the community, with
    their conflicting and unusual perspectives and
    requirements--some commercial, some scientific, some
    engineering-based, and some just oddball. All these groups were
    expected to come to a common agreement. This is politics par
    excellence. Pride of citizenship was conferred by the
    attentiveness of ARPA to the group and the fame of some of its
    principals.</p>

    <p>Finally, the curious fact about the Common Lisp effort was
    that even though its apparent product was a specification of
    Common Lisp in the form of a book, the members of the community
    never worked on the text of that book. There were no artifacts
    that formed the center of the community; people, in general,
    did not contribute code, text, or editing expertise. The
    writing was done entirely by Guy Steele and the other members
    of the Quinquevirate. The community was there to make
    decisions, much as do legislatures and constitutional
    conventions. A newcomer to the Common Lisp community needed to
    listen and read the email archives--until Steele's first draft
    there was no artifact available to study and change; and after,
    only Steele could change the draft. The day-to-day activity
    consisted of political and technical debate followed by making
    specific decisions, which means that the Common Lisp project
    was essentially all community.</p>

    <h2>Who This Book Is Intended For</h2>

    <p>We wrote this book to help business executives understand
    when and how an open-source strategy can help them to achieve
    their company's business goals. We also want to provide support
    for the managers charged with implementing that strategy in
    their day-to-day work running a project that makes use of open
    source.</p>

    <p>The book is also aimed at the engineers who may need to work
    on open-source projects. We want to give them an idea of what
    they will experience and what will be expected of them. We also
    want to give them the information they will need to educate
    their managers and co-workers about open source.</p>

    <p>Third, the book is for anyone interested in a better
    understanding of open source--its larger history, its
    philosophy, and its future prospects.</p>

  <div id="software-developers">
    <h2>Software Developers</h2>

    <p>Since we wrote the first draft of this book, the depth of
    the recession of the early twenty-first century has made itself
    felt in the software industry. We don't want to make this book
    specific to a particular era, but we want to point out to
    software developers of any time period the educational and
    experiential advantages of working with open source. It is
    unlikely that open-source code will disappear. This means that
    open-source systems will form the basis of a significant
    portion of our computing infrastructure for many years. An
    individual who has experience working with open-source software
    will enjoy a variety of advantages.</p>

    <p>Experience with open source can add value to your skill set.
    Operating systems, web servers, scripting-level languages,
    wikis, weblogs, email infrastructure, and many other facilities
    come from the open-source world, and experience with these
    pieces of software is valuable. Experience working with
    open-source projects can be of value to companies that have or
    plan to have open-source projects of their own. Knowing the
    roles of the members and having a good idea of how the process
    works is essential for companies to succeed with open source,
    and knowledge comes more from experience than from books.</p>

    <p>Working with an open-source project will give you experience
    working in a distributed development environment and perhaps
    working with non-English speakers from different cultural
    backgrounds. Increasingly companies are locating development
    groups around the world, both in-sourced and out-sourced, and
    experience in this sort of environment can be essential.</p>

    <p>Open-source projects work using documents and written
    communications. The documents can be as simple as an emailed
    specification or design rationale, but they are documents
    nevertheless. Working through writing is a way to bring more
    discipline to the development process. Moreover, you can become
    a better writer by practicing writing, and working on an
    email-heavy project will give you lots of practice.</p>

    <p>In an open-source project, the source code is available for
    inspection, and the designers and implementors of the software
    are generally available and willing to answer questions.
    Reading (and critiquing) source code is one of the best ways to
    learn about design and implementation. Open-source software is
    available for continual improvement, so it might be higher
    quality than commercial code and, thus, a better educational
    experience.</p>

    <p>Before open source became prevalent, self-training in many
    of these areas was a hit-or-miss affair. Learning software
    development requires interaction, and it was difficult before
    Internet-based open-source projects existed to find places to
    get the sort of interaction needed for training.</p>

  <div id="open-source-as-business-strategy">
    <h2>Open Source as Business Strategy</h2>

    <p>Making a public open-source project successful takes more
    than a press release and putting some code outside the
    firewall. Open source is a development methodology, but
    companies whose thinking stops there will find the experience
    disappointing. Open source is sometimes called a lifestyle,
    which means that successful open-source projects operate under
    a set of cultural conventions that may be foreign or difficult
    for some companies to accept. Public-open source is not a
    cost-saving mechanism, and it takes a careful business analysis
    to justify using it.</p>

    <p>This book focuses on what a company needs to do to make open
    source a part of its business. This starts with understanding
    the business reasons for using open source and goes on to the
    details of day-to-day project activities. Included are examples
    of how companies such as Sun, IBM, HP, and Cisco Systems have
    successfully benefited from their use of open source.</p>

    <p>Our examples tend to be drawn from Sun projects. The reason
    for this is that we have had the opportunity to observe not
    only the reaction of the community and pundits to
    company-sponsored open-source projects and the reports of
    people working on the inside on these projects, but also the
    internal discussions, pro and con, good and bad, of the
    decision makers. We were able to see what advice was taken and
    not taken, and what the results were. Sun is neither the best
    practitioner of open source as a business strategy nor the
    worst. Sun's record is spotty with some good successes and
    several embarrassments; the company embraces some of the
    fundamental tenets of openness and working with a community
    that are required for a successful use of open source as a
    strategy, but it often fails to embrace them thoroughly enough
    to realize all the benefits.</p>

    <p>We do not advocate using open source blindly as a strategy,
    and we are not die-hard promoters of open source. We hope this
    book is a balanced look at the pros and cons of open source,
    along with tested advice on how to succeed once open source has
    been chosen as a part of a company's strategy.</p>
