  <h1>8. How To Build Momentum</h1>

  <p>The previous chapters of this book have described all the
  elements that go into creating and running an open-source
  project. In this chapter, we discuss some things you can do to
  increase your project's chances for success. This builds on the
  material in the section <a href="IHE-55.html#74306">Building a
  Community</a> in Chapter 6, which covers the basic things to do.
  The next chapter focuses on what <em>not</em> to do based on
  lessons learned from the failures and mistakes we've observed in
  various open-source projects.</p>

  <p>The ideas in this chapter apply to any open-source project;
  however, we want to emphasize that a company engaging in an
  open-source project has many additional resources that can be
  used to further the project in ways that are not available to
  individual volunteers. In addition to developers, a company also
  employs technical writers, user-interface experts, graphic
  artists, website designers, technology evangelists, marketing
  people, project managers, and people with other skills, all of
  whom can help with different aspects of the project. Once they
  understand the open-source process, these folks can make major
  contributions to help the project become a success. All the
  activities that your company does to support a proprietary
  product--marketing, advertising, support, and training--are also
  needed for an open-source project.</p>

  <p>As you read over this chapter, remember what your business
  goals are and focus on how to achieve them. Creating a successful
  open-source project is only part of your strategy. As the project
  grows and develops, it will take on a life of its own. You need
  to balance the needs of the open-source community against your
  business goals. For the most part, they should be aligned toward
  a common purpose, and developers from both inside and outside of
  your company will work together to achieve them. Where they are
  orthogonal, you should let the community proceed on its own. If
  they are opposed, you need to be very upfront about communicating
  your plans and reach some agreement that does not alienate or
  frustrate your community.</p>

  <p>For example, one of the business goals of the NetBeans project
  was for Sun to sell proprietary modules that added functionality
  to the basic NetBeans IDE. Developing similar modules as open
  source in NetBeans would undermine this goal because the
  functionality would then be available for free. However, outside
  developers have every right to expect that any useful modules
  they create can become part of NetBeans. So the decision was made
  that any module could be developed for NetBeans. It also was
  decided that when a NetBeans module duplicated the functionality
  of one of Sun's proprietary modules the Sun version would be open
  sourced. In this way, the functionality level of NetBeans would
  continually go up, which would be good for the health of the
  project. Sun could make this decision because the Sun engineers
  were confident that they would always be able to develop new
  proprietary modules that Sun could sell, so they did not need to
  hold tightly to their existing ones.</p>

  <div id="marketing-your-project">
    <h2>Marketing Your Project</h2>

    <p>As with any product, marketing plays a key role in the
    success of your project. For you to be successful, people need
    to hear about your project, understand what it does, and see
    how it can help them. Getting the message out about your
    project is one job marketing can help with.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="what-is-your-projects-story">
    <h2>What Is Your Project's Story?</h2>

    <p>Before your project is ever announced to the world, you need
    to come up with a compelling story that describes what your
    project is aiming at--something to get people excited about it.
    This is the message that will attract people to your project
    both as users and potential developers. If the story is not
    appealing, then people will not be interested in participating
    and won't get involved.</p>

    <p>For most open-source projects, this story is focused on the
    technology being developed. For example, the Apache HTTP Server
    Project exists to build the best web server. The following are
    statements of the story for Apache.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The Apache Project is a collaborative software development
      effort aimed at creating a robust, commercial-grade,
      featureful, and freely-available source code implementation
      of an HTTP (Web) server.<sup><a href="#fn1" class=
      "footnoteRef" id="fnref1" name="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient
      and extensible server which provides HTTP services in sync
      with the current HTTP standards.<sup><a href="#fn2" class=
      "footnoteRef" id="fnref2" name="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Other projects have a more user-centered focus, as seen in
    the following comment about GNOME.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The GNOME project was born as an effort to create an
      entirely free desktop environment for free systems. From the
      start, the main objective of GNOME has been to provide a user
      friendly suite of applications and an easy-to-use
      desktop.<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"
      name="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>You need to determine what sort of people you are hoping to
    attract to your project. If you want to mainly target
    end-users, then you need to talk about what they can do with
    the software you are developing, which of their problems your
    software solves. If you want to focus on developers who will
    contribute code to your project, then emphasizing the
    technological aspects may work, but remember that most people
    working on open-source projects do so because they need to use
    the resulting software--your developers will also be users.</p>

    <p>Creating a good story is hard work. The story needs to
    express the shared purpose behind your project. It will attract
    people who share this vision and are willing to work to make it
    real. Moreover, the story should infuse all aspects of the
    project so that it provides guidance whenever a strategic
    decision must be made. In literary theory, such a story is
    called a <em>topos</em> and can be defined as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>a conventionalized expression or passage in text which
      comes to be used as a resource for the composition of
      additional texts.<sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id=
      "fnref4" name="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><em>Topos</em> literally means &quot;place&quot; or
    &quot;location&quot; in Greek, and a topos is a place from
    which similar stories can be woven. An example from literature
    is the story of the Garden of Eden. Anyone in a Western
    Judeo-Christian culture when asked to tell a story about the
    Garden of Eden will probably come up with a story consistent
    with the vision of creation the Garden of Eden presents. An
    example of a technology-related topos is Moore's Law, which is
    regularly used as the basis of stories about the future of
    computing.</p>

    <p>For an example of the power of a good story, consider the
    one developed for the Jini project. As described earlier, Jini
    technology is a thin layer built on top of Java that allows
    applications to be written as remote services that can be
    dynamically deployed and located over a network. The obvious
    story is that Jini is another middleware framework for
    distributed applications. But this story has a technology focus
    that would have severely limited the spread of the Jini
    message--indeed the term <em>middleware</em> causes even
    developers to yawn. Instead, the Jini marketing team built a
    story around what Jini technology would mean to users; that
    story generated lots of excitement in developers, the press,
    and the marketplace.</p>

    <p>The Jini topos speaks of a world of &quot;intelligent
    services&quot; that &quot;simply connect&quot; to form
    &quot;spontaneous networks&quot; and describes a set of home,
    office, and automobile scenarios derived from this topos. The
    concepts &quot;simply connect&quot; and &quot;spontaneous
    networks&quot; address how people relate to the technology. The
    Jini topos was highly effective and created a thriving
    community and associated technology--as hoped--along with
    thriving E-Speak, UPnP, and SOAP communities and associated
    technologies.</p>

    <p>This type of story is especially important for any project
    with ubiquity as a goal. For Jini, success did not rest in
    extensive development of the core Jini protocols but rather in
    nurturing communities to create a wide range of Jini-based
    services. The story needed to inspire companies to want their
    products--be they printers, cameras, or whatever--to
    &quot;simply connect&quot; by using Jini technology.</p>

    <p>Contrast this with the Apache topos (described earlier)
    which speaks of web servers and technology for making them
    effective. Whereas Jini projects tend to fan out, creating new
    services for people to use, the Apache Software Foundation's
    projects tend to focus on adding web server functionality and
    adopting related technologies such as Java Server Pages,
    servlets, and XML.</p>

    <p>Topoi and storytelling, however, might not go over well with
    your highly technical developers. Although the developers at
    Sun in the Jini group were involved in the story-making, they
    quickly came to believe that the story was misguided, because
    it talked exclusively about a world of small devices when in
    fact Jini was also capable in middleware and other high-end
    applications, such as distributed and scientific computing.
    They became upset that Sun was actually not working diligently
    in the device space and so to them the story was a lie.</p>

    <p>The idea of a topos, however, is that a topos enables people
    to make their own stories about their own areas of interest. In
    fact, most middleware application writers had little trouble
    understanding that &quot;simply connect&quot; and
    &quot;spontaneous networks&quot; were either literally or
    metaphorically true for them, although they worried that less
    sophisticated people might not be able to understand the
    connection.</p>

    <p>If you decide to build a topos, make sure your developers
    understand what it's for and buy into the topos you create.</p>

    <p>At its best, the topos as a story-making story attracts and
    provides room for experimentation and variation beyond what the
    initiators envisioned.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="the-name-matters">
    <h2>The Name Matters</h2>

    <p>What you call your open-source project is important. You
    need to choose a name that will attract developers. In effect,
    you are creating a brand identity just like any commercial
    product. You want to create an identity that matches your
    target audience and that is consistent with your story. Most
    important, you don't want a name that is too slick or connected
    with a commercial product.</p>

    <p>This can be complicated if part of your business plan is to
    develop a commercial product based on the open-source version.
    You need to recognize the different naming requirements for
    each version.</p>

    <p>For example, when Sun was deciding how to name its various
    Java IDE products, it used the more formal &quot;Forte for
    Java&quot; name for the Sun-branded versions and the more
    developer-friendly &quot;NetBeans&quot; name for the
    open-source version. Keeping the NetBeans name was important
    for historical reasons, but as a name it does not really
    describe the project--a Java IDE and more generally a portable
    tools platform--so another name might have been better.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="getting-the-message-out">
    <h2>Getting the Message Out</h2>

    <p>Once you have a good story about your project, you need to
    tell it to people. This is a traditional role for marketing.
    When you have a major piece of news, such as when you first
    announce your project, your company's marketing machine can see
    to it that the world hears about it. For very important
    announcements, this can include major stories in the press. For
    instance, the initial stories about Sun's Jini technology
    appeared in the <em>New York Times</em> , <em>Business
    Week,</em> and <em>Wired.</em> When top Sun executives such as
    Scott McNealy and Bill Joy gave talks or met with the press,
    they made sure to talk about what was new with Jini, JXTA,
    NetBeans, OpenOffice, and the other open-source projects Sun
    was working on. Major stories were also featured on Sun's
    website, along with links to stories elsewhere on the Web.</p>

    <p>In addition to the big-splash type of announcement, you
    should also maintain ongoing low-key press coverage. This is
    essential because there is often a long time between the
    initial announcement and the final release. You don't want
    people to think that your project is dead, so be sure to
    publicize ongoing activities such as community meetings,
    working group meetings, and significant milestones. These can
    be as short as a single sentence in a column of industry news
    in a magazine. Such stories should also be featured on the home
    page of your project's website. Note that some PR folks are
    interested only in handling major stories and will balk at the
    smaller scale needed for ongoing coverage. If they won't do it,
    then you need to find someone else who will.</p>

    <p>If your project involves infrastructure or something that
    can be used as part of another application or website, try to
    find ways to take advantage of the pride some people find in
    using open-source code or in the technology of your project.
    Create a logo, a graphic, or a sound that can easily be cut and
    pasted onto the splash screen of other applications or onto the
    website of some proud user of your stuff. The logo can link to
    your website, drawing traffic.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="going-beyond-standard-marketing">
    <h2>Going beyond Standard Marketing</h2>

    <p>The conventional marketing channels--major newspapers and
    magazines, trade press, and trade shows--are important, but an
    open-source project has other ways to reach potential users and
    developers, including newsgroups, mailing lists, webzines, and
    weblogs. Use all of these channels to market your project. You
    should encourage your developers and users to post to whatever
    online forums are appropriate.</p>

    <p>It is important to use a different writing style for
    material sent over these alternative channels. This is a matter
    of <em>voice.</em> Richard Rhodes, author of <em>The Making of
    the Atomic Bomb,</em> wrote:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Every work of writing, no matter how modest, no matter how
      seemingly &quot;objective,&quot; no matter how
      &quot;true,&quot; is composed in one or more fictional
      voices. &quot;Someone&quot; &quot;tells&quot; every story,
      even the copy on the back of cereal boxes, even a legal
      contract, even a street sign. We may not pause to puzzle out
      who &quot;someone&quot; is--the author may not even have
      thought about her choice of voice in advance--but we register
      &quot;someone&quot; 's presence and assess his statements
      accordingly.<sup><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id=
      "fnref5" name="fnref5">5</a></sup></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Almost every reader is aware of the voice behind any
    writing, and so if you want to build a community, you need to
    make that community feel like a group of people, people with
    distinct and human voices. Company writing typically tries to
    appear as neutral as possible, as much like an encyclopedia as
    possible, so there is little possibility of a reader hearing a
    voice behind the writing, a voice expressing an opinion. The
    company in many cases wants the reader to believe that what is
    written is objectively true. Marketing writing often puts a
    cheerleading sort of voice behind the words.</p>

    <p>Anything that has a slick marketing feel or inauthentic
    voice will be rejected and probably will give people a negative
    view of your project. Avoid hype. What <em>does</em> work is
    honest talk from developer to developer or user to user. As
    such, it is the opposite of the typical anonymous marketing
    message broadcast to a target audience. Instead, it is a
    message from a real person attempting to engage in an ongoing
    conversation with other individuals. Each message helps
    establish the reputation of the writer. Your employees need to
    become known and respected members of the community in order to
    best communicate about your project. A big test of their
    honesty is their being able to admit errors or mistakes and to
    acknowledge the successes of other projects.</p>

    <p>One last point is that it is very important to give credit
    to the folks who did the work. If a number of outside
    developers contributed to your open-source project, be sure to
    acknowledge their efforts. You may even want to feature their
    efforts because it shows that the project goes beyond your
    company.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="focus-on-your-users-and-contributors">
    <h2>Focus on Your Users and Contributors</h2>

    <p>One of the most crucial factors in your project's success is
    releasing a useful product--one that works and solves a real
    problem. This is exactly the same problem faced by any company
    releasing a commercial software application. Open source works
    best with at least several thousand users, so your product must
    first attract that many. Then the open-source process will
    encourage those users to provide feedback that will make your
    project more in tune with the needs of potential users.
    Remember that one of the main points of doing open source is
    continuous design, which requires that you pay attention to the
    continuous feedback you're getting from the community.</p>

    <p>If you have such a large code base that you plan on
    releasing it in several installments in order to give you time
    to scrub it, then make sure that the first release can build a
    complete and useful product. Try to release the parts that are
    most valuable to users and developers first. As you release
    subsequent pieces, additional news stories about your project
    will be generated.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="target-your-potential-audience">
    <h2>Target Your Potential Audience</h2>

    <p>As with any product, you need to identify what sort of
    person will benefit from using your product. You need to make
    sure your message reaches those people. This is where you can
    make use of standard marketing and advertising.</p>

    <p>You also should target other companies that will benefit
    either from using your product directly or using it to add
    value to their customers. For example, any company doing Java
    development can use NetBeans to increase the productivity of
    its programmers. Other companies create commercial products
    that run on top of NetBeans. In both cases, companies have an
    incentive to assign their own developers to work on NetBeans to
    add features they need, and indeed a number of companies have
    already done so. For any open-source project, companies provide
    a good source of potential developers.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="make-users-successful">
    <h2>Make Users Successful</h2>

    <p>Installing and learning to use a piece of new software is
    always a major hurdle for people. As discussed in <sup><a href=
    "#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6" name=
    "fnref6">6</a></sup> and GNOME.<sup><a href="#fn7" class=
    "footnoteRef" id="fnref7" name="fnref7">7</a></sup></p>

    <p>You may want to have a separate area for each different
    category of visitors. This might be as minimal as having
    additional sections in your FAQs, or you might have multiple
    web pages with specialized documents for each group. For
    example the OpenOffice project<sup><a href="#fn8" class=
    "footnoteRef" id="fnref8" name="fnref8">8</a></sup> has
    localized versions of much of its website for speakers of
    different languages (for example, Czech, French, German, and
    Japanese), whereas the GNOME project provides separate web
    pages for users and for application developers.</p>

    <p>Another question you must address is how much visitors can
    participate. Can they browse mail archives, subscribe to
    mailing lists, post to mailing lists, add comments to
    discussion forums, or edit wiki pages? Generally, you want to
    maximize how much information visitors can see on your website
    and minimize barriers to entry. However, you also need to worry
    about possible disruptions of conversations; furthermore your
    community members may not want to discuss controversial topics
    in public.</p>

    <p>Although many visitors will be new to your project and may
    need help navigating your website, others will be quite
    knowledgeable about your project--they may visit your project's
    website frequently to see what's new. Do not assume that all
    the people who care about your project get their news via the
    mailing lists; feature news about your project on the home page
    and update it frequently.</p>

    <p>The definition of <em>visitor</em> is someone without a
    community identity, so any participation visitors do is done
    anonymously. It is not necessary to encourage your visitors to
    join. However, you should make clear what the benefits and
    requirements of membership are. The main reason people join an
    online community is to do something that requires membership.
    For an open-source project, that something is typically being
    able to ask questions in order to get help in using the
    project's code and participating in the discussion of the
    project's future.</p>

    <div id="welcome-your-novices">
      <h3>Welcome Your Novices</h3>

      <p>Novices are people who have taken the step to join your
      project. They may have registered on your project's website
      or maybe just subscribed to one of your project's mailing
      lists. They are interested in your project, but need to learn
      the ropes about how your community functions. They need to
      learn what they can do as members and how to behave.</p>

      <p>When they join, you need to welcome them into your
      community. A simple way to do this is by sending a welcoming
      email message. This note should be from a real person, even
      if it is sent automatically from the mailing list server.
      Have either the project's founder or your community manager
      write this welcoming message. It should confirm the novice's
      membership and explain how the community works. You shouldn't
      overload new members with information but rather provide
      links to what they are likely to need to know as they get
      started working on your project.</p>

      <p>On your website, you should help novices learn who's who
      in your community. Include a page listing the major
      contributors, community leaders, and module owners. If you
      can include pictures of folks, all the better. Introduce
      novices to your regulars and leaders at community
      meetings.</p>

      <p>Depending on your project, you may want to have a special
      mailing list, discussion forum, or even a subproject for
      newcomers to get their initial questions answered. This can
      keep the same basic questions from constantly being posted to
      your main mailing lists. It lets novices help each other,
      which sets a good tone for later. This is another reason to
      have good FAQ lists and to regularly link to them in the
      major mailing lists.</p>

      <p>Be sure to encourage a friendly attitude that is tolerant
      of inappropriate postings by novices on project mailing
      lists. Gently let the offenders know how your project does
      things, without personally attacking them. Redirect
      inappropriate messages to the correct mailing list.
      Discourage flaming. This attitude encourages novices to
      participate and is good for your community of regulars
      too.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="reward-your-regulars">
      <h3>Reward Your Regulars</h3>

      <p>Regulars are the lifeblood of your project; they are the
      folks who do the work to make your project a success. They
      answer questions on the mailing lists, report bugs and bug
      fixes, contribute code and new ideas, tell others about your
      project, and do all the other work necessary for your project
      to move forward. Do everything you can to encourage your
      regulars to participate and to retain their interest in your
      project.</p>

      <p>Because many open-source projects are meritocracies, be
      sure to recognize people doing good work. Be sure to add them
      to the project's list of contributors. Reward them by
      granting them CVS commit privileges. Invite them to be part
      of the core group. Encourage them to take responsibility for
      part of the design or a module of code.</p>

      <p>A good way to show appreciation for the work your regulars
      do is to have a spotlight feature on your website's home page
      or in your project's newsletter that highlights individuals
      and their work. You can also encourage them to give a
      presentation at a community meeting. Not only does it reward
      them directly, but it also can educate your community about
      new functionality and encourage other regulars and novices by
      giving them an example of what your community values.</p>

      <p>Another way to show that you value your regulars is to use
      resources from your company to further refine one of their
      contributions to help bring it up to project-quality
      standards, as described earlier. Even having one of your
      graphic artists create a cool logo for a subproject may be
      appreciated. Just be sure they feel you are working with them
      and not trying to take over from them.</p>

      <p>The ultimate way to retain your best regulars is to hire
      them! It is always hard to find top talent and especially to
      know how they will function in your company's culture. With
      open source, you have a way to try out people and determine
      whether they fit in with your current team. Even if they do
      not live near any of your company's offices you already know
      that they can work productively from wherever they do live
      (that is, remotely). For example, Sun Labs is supporting a
      small open-source project called Electric, a computer-aided
      design system for electrical circuits. When one volunteer
      really distinguished himself by his contributions, Sun hired
      him--even though he lives in Moscow and the Sun Labs team is
      in California.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="empower-your-leaders">
      <h3>Empower Your Leaders</h3>

      <p>Your leaders are the people who keep your community
      running. Some will be outside volunteers and some will be
      your employees--a successful project will have a healthy mix
      of both. Some will have formal leadership roles, such as
      module owner, but many roles will be more informal. For an
      open-source project, leadership is all about having a vision
      and working with others to make it happen; it's not about
      being in charge, making decisions, or giving orders.</p>

      <p>The leaders in your community will naturally take on many
      different roles:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Welcoming newcomers to the project and answering their
        questions.</li>

        <li>Answering technical and procedural questions on your
        project mailing lists.</li>

        <li>Guiding discussions to help them reach a
        conclusion.</li>

        <li>Selecting high-quality content to highlight on your
        website or in your newsletter.</li>

        <li>Coordinating activities such as releases, community
        meetings, or trade-show demos.</li>

        <li>Providing quality checks on contributed code.</li>

        <li>Policing community discussions to keep them civil, and
        redirecting messages to the correct mailing list.</li>

        <li>Resolving conflicts and helping the community to make
        decisions.</li>

        <li>Solving complex technical problems.</li>

        <li>Creating compelling visions and directions for the
        project.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You need to watch your regulars to see which are starting
      to assume any of these roles and encourage them to do so. Try
      to recruit outside volunteers to oversee visible
      project-related activities such as module owner, release
      manager, or newsletter editor. Establish as soon as possible
      that community members do important things.</p>

      <p>Be sure to provide support for new leaders. It may be as
      simple as your community manager trading some tips via email
      on guiding discussions or assigning an experienced module
      owner to mentor a new one. You may want to give all new
      module owners training on the various tools your project
      uses. But recognize that volunteers have limited time, so
      don't push them to act like full-time employees.</p>

      <p>You can reward your leaders and make them more visible by
      giving them a special place to express their ideas and
      opinions. This could be a column in the community newsletter
      or a series of articles on your website--you could encourage
      them to write weblogs featured on the project's website. If a
      leader is not interested in writing, then post an interview
      instead.</p>

      <p>When you have project-related discussions and meetings
      inside your company, try to invite outside volunteer leaders
      to participate. Be sure to keep them informed on any
      decisions you make. All of your project's leaders need to be
      kept in the loop. You do not want to create an us-versus-them
      attitude.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="honor-your-elders">
      <h3>Honor Your Elders</h3>

      <p>Elders are respected long-time regulars and leaders who
      are your community's mentors, teachers, and advisors. They
      provide role models for newcomers and regulars on how to
      behave properly. They may have stepped down from more active
      roles such as a leader or contributor, but your community can
      still benefit from their sharing their knowledge.</p>

      <p>Some projects take no notice of when major contributors
      move on; at most they may add their names to a list of
      emeritus contributors and also remove them from the list of
      active developers. The Apache Software Foundation's projects
      have a rule that committers who have been inactive for 6
      months or more may lose their status as committers. Although
      people can regain their committer status by just requesting
      it on the project's developer mailing list, the fact that
      they lost it indicates a certain indifference toward formerly
      valued community members.</p>

      <p>Try to identify potential elders and encourage them to
      continue to participate in some way. They may not have time
      to write code, but perhaps they would like to follow various
      design discussions--they certainly have the knowledge to do
      so, including knowledge of your project's history and why
      previous decisions were made the way they were. If any of
      your senior developers move on to another project in your
      company, see whether you can get their new managers to
      approve their continuing, though perhaps minimal, involvement
      on your project mailing lists.</p>

      <p>One way to show that you value your elders is to have a
      special mailing list for them where the community can ask
      their opinions on important matters that come up. You can
      also try to solicit their advice on the regular project
      mailing lists. Include them in activities at your community
      meetings and interview them on your website or in your
      newsletter.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div id="communication-creates-community">
    <h2>Communication Creates Community</h2>

    <p>Everyone involved with your project--users, designers,
    developers, and evangelists--should know what is happening with
    it. Everyone needs to know what's new and be able to
    participate in discussions about various project issues, plans,
    and designs. As is mentioned in the section <sup><a href="#fn9"
    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9" name="fnref9">9</a></sup> was
    established by Ward Cunningham in 1995. Ward originally called
    it the WikiWikiWeb from the word <em>wiki</em> <em>wiki</em> ,
    which means &quot;quick&quot; in the Hawaiian language. For
    another example, check out the Wikipedia,<sup><a href="#fn10"
    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10" name="fnref10">10</a></sup>
    where, in only 3 years, the online community has created an
    open-content encyclopedia of almost 300,000 entries (as of July
    2004). Open-source projects have recently begun to use wikis.
    The Apache Software Foundation has a wiki<sup><a href="#fn11"
    class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11" name="fnref11">11</a></sup>
    used by its various projects, and the GNOME project has set up
    a wiki<sup><a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"
    name="fnref12">12</a></sup> to provide support.</p>

    <p>Writing in wiki pages consists of either unsigned,
    deliberately anonymous text that is intended to be community
    material which others are encouraged to update and improve (for
    example, a page on the Apache wiki describing how to do log
    rotation for the James mail/news server) or a series of signed
    comments where people hold a form of conversation as they try
    to reach an understanding of the issues involved (for example,
    a page discussing which Java IDE to use, also on the Apache
    wiki). Anyone can both reorganize the conversational threads to
    clarify the material, possibly moving them to new pages, and
    revise the community material based on the comments made. Over
    time more and more community-owned text is created expressing
    the community consensus and the concluded discussions may be
    removed. Many wikis provide simple version-control mechanisms
    so that no text is lost, and archiving important versions of a
    wiki page can make looking at history easy.</p>

    <p>Most wikis have a special <em>RecentChanges</em> page that
    displays an automatically generated index of all the wiki pages
    that have been changed recently. Many people check the
    <em>RecentChanges</em> page frequently to see what is new on
    the wiki.</p>

    <p>Many people's immediate reaction when they first hear about
    wiki is that it cannot possibly work. People worry that someone
    will come along and delete what is there or write random
    garbage all over pages. This indeed can, and does occasionally,
    happen, but as soon as the wiki's community members notice the
    problem, one of them erases the graffiti and restores the
    page's original contents from the previous archived version.
    After continually having their &quot;work&quot; removed, the
    offending individuals usually quickly give up and go
    elsewhere.</p>

    <p>A more common problem is that no community consensus
    emerges, possibly because the community is split into opposing
    viewpoints on some issue. Then it is important that the
    community try to express each of the viewpoints rather than
    resolving the issue to a single &quot;correct&quot; one. This
    requires a real sense of community and a respect for the
    beliefs of other community members. The Wikipedia calls this
    writing with a <em>neutral point of view</em> and has a good
    description of how to do this.<sup><a href="#fn13" class=
    "footnoteRef" id="fnref13" name="fnref13">13</a></sup></p>

    <p>Another reason that discussions sometimes do not resolve is
    that the community is exploring a new area and just doesn't
    know enough yet. In this case, the discussions remain visible
    as a reminder that the issue is still open. As individuals and
    hence the community learn more, people may eventually add to
    the discussion and reorganize it.</p>

    <p>The wide-open nature of the wiki and most people's
    unfamiliarity with wikis can present a barrier. People can be
    afraid of what will happen to what they write or unsure what
    type of contributions are acceptable. The tone set by the
    community will either encourage new folks to join in or
    discourage them from doing so. Once people contribute and begin
    to edit wiki pages, they gain a feeling of empowerment and
    often develop a vested interest in overseeing the wiki as a
    whole.</p>

    <p>A wiki is a community effort and each develops its own
    culture. In general, the sense of working together to build a
    better understanding seems to encourage people to be more
    polite than many other Internet activities do--perhaps because
    on a wiki any flames, spam, and trivia can be easily deleted,
    while the constructive comments typically expand and grow.</p>

    <p>Coming to a common place, sharing a vocabulary, and working
    together over time on common goals all help to make the people
    using a wiki into an actual community.</p>

    <p>For more information on wikis, see the book <em>The Wiki
    Way: Collaboration and Sharing on the Internet</em> by Bo Leuf
    and Ward Cunningham.</p>

    <div id="weblogs-or-blogs">
      <h3>Weblogs or Blogs</h3>

      <p>A weblog (also known by its contraction, &quot;blog&quot;)
      is an online journal with entries on whatever topic or topics
      interest the author, usually including links to online
      articles, news, or other blogs. Blogs enable people without
      much web experience to create, format, and post diarylike
      entries with ease. Blogs are a great way for an individual to
      have a place to express opinions.</p>

      <p>We have discussed mostly communities built up by
      collaboration, but the blog focuses on the individual.
      Helping to create a strong individual identity also helps to
      build community--community is about getting to know the
      individual members in the community better over time,
      something that blogs help to do. They also help to bridge the
      gaps among multiple communities that the blogger is a member
      of. Many people who write blogs include a list of links to
      other blogs that they read. This <em>blogroll</em> helps to
      define the blogging community that a person identifies
      with.</p>

      <p>A good way for an open-source project to make use of blogs
      is to have a news page that displays the latest blog entries
      from selected community members or a project group blog. Most
      blogs provide an RSS (<em>Rich Site Summary</em> or
      <em>Really Simple Syndication</em> ) feed that other web
      pages can subscribe to. Using this RSS feed, a project can
      feature on its home page headlines for the most recent
      relevant blog entries.</p>

      <p>Having key people in your project write a blog (called
      &quot;blogging&quot;) is another channel for getting
      important information to your community; it is also a good
      way to reach people outside of your community who are
      interested in your project. Anyone can subscribe to the RSS
      feeds from your blogs and thus get timely updated news
      concerning your project.</p>

      <p>A good book on how to write a blog is <em>The Weblog
      Handbook: Practical Advice on Creating and Maintaining Your
      Blog</em> by Rebecca Blood.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div id="community-outreach">
    <h2>Community Outreach</h2>

    <p>Your project does not exist in a vacuum. Strengthen your
    connections with other open-source projects. Do this to be a
    good citizen and because it will benefit your project. If your
    software engineers establish good reputations with the
    open-source community it will benefit your company.</p>

    <p>Being active in the larger world of open source will help
    you with your open-source project. Your project infrastructure
    undoubtedly will use many open-source tools such as CVS,
    Bugzilla, and Perl, so you may want to become involved in the
    debates about their future development. Seeing how other
    projects are run will give you ideas about what your project
    should or should not do.</p>

    <p>Market your project to other open-source efforts. These
    provide a natural audience for the software you develop and are
    a source of potential contributors. For example, if you create
    an application that runs on Linux, then you should work with
    groups creating Linux distributions so that your application
    will be included--OpenOffice is part of the Linux distributions
    from RedHat, SuSE, and Mandrake.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="establishing-credibility-with-the-open-source-crowd">
    <h2>Establishing Credibility with the Open-Source Crowd</h2>

    <p>Beyond the day-to-day activities of your project, there are
    some other things you can do to establish better credibility
    with the larger open-source community. The bigger and more
    visible your project is, the more important it is for people
    working on other open-source projects to see you as being part
    of this larger open-source community.</p>

    <p>First, it will help if you are using a license that has been
    blessed by the more well-known spokespeople for open source,
    such as Richard Stallman, Tim O'Reilly, Bruce Perens, and Eric
    Raymond. If your project uses an OSI-certified open-source
    license such as BSD, Mozilla, or the GNU GPL, then these
    spokespeople will be able to go on record as saying your
    project is true open source and a Good Thing. If your project
    is using a proprietary or shared source license, they and the
    press will be sure to point out that your project is not open
    source. This issue arose with Sun's Jini project, which uses
    the Sun Community Source License (SCSL)--even though Sun was
    quite clear in stating that it was creating a gated community
    and not trying to do true open source, the press and some
    open-source pundits kept saying, &quot;Yes, but it's not open
    source.&quot; This deflected attention from the Jini technology
    and slowed down the growth of the project around it.</p>

    <p>Second, you should establish strong, positive connections
    with other open-source projects. If your project uses tools or
    modules developed by other open-source projects or your project
    produces tools or modules that other open-source projects could
    benefit from, then not only should you be involved with these
    other projects, but you should try to entwine their projects
    and yours as much as possible. An ideal situation is for your
    project to be part of the planning process--for future features
    and the timing of releases--for those other projects. The
    OpenOffice project started with the intent to integrate its
    office productivity suite with the GNOME desktop, so it became
    involved in the GNOME community, contributing code and bug
    fixes back to the GNOME project. As the collaboration deepened,
    technologies and components from each project became part of
    the other, so that OpenOffice can be said to be deeply embedded
    into GNOME. The more your project is seen as not only
    supporting but deeply integrated with other open-source
    efforts, the more your project--and thus your company--will be
    considered a good member of the larger open-source
    community.</p>

    <p>You should also establish dialogs with open-source
    developers not involved with your project. Have your internal
    developers both read and post to places such as
    Slashdot.<sup><a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"
    name="fnref14">14</a></sup> Encourage them to start individual
    weblogs. The more individuals from your company that people see
    participating in open-source forums--especially when their
    email addresses include your company's domain name--the harder
    it will be for them to see your company as a large faceless
    corporation. It is fine for your company's developers to
    express whatever views they have, but they should strive for
    some restraint and avoid too much flaming. As mentioned in the
    section on <a href="IHE-53.html#48661">Posting Etiquette</a>
    (Chapter 6), they need to remember that even though they are
    posting as individuals, people will read their notes as being
    your company's official policy. When your company's actions are
    attacked, they should wait a bit to first give outside people a
    chance to defend your company--statements from people not
    employed by your company are more effective than statements
    from employees. Of course, if the criticism is valid, your
    developers should immediately acknowledge it and fix
    things.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="harvesting-innovation">
    <h2>Harvesting Innovation</h2>

    <p>If you're trying to do innovation based on your open-source
    project, then you need to do more than just successfully run
    the project--you need to harvest what we have called triggers.
    Harvesting from your community doesn't involve any sort of
    thievery or unethical behavior--it means simply finding out
    what your community members are doing; what problems they're
    having; what books, trends, and technologies they are engaged
    in; what conferences they attend; and how they are using your
    open-source software.Harvesting Innovation</p>

    <p>Your community manager can lead the way by being sociable
    and getting to know the active members of the community. Your
    developers can also get to know community members. Without
    being intrusive, you can easily come to find out what kinds of
    uses your community members are making of your open-source
    software. Are there problems that seem beyond the scope of the
    open-source project itself? Are there related problems that
    could be addressed with other products or add-ons? Are people
    using your technology clustering in application areas you
    didn't anticipate? Are they talking about a new technology or
    reading a new book? Are they working on some particular other
    open-source projects? Are they upgrading their hardware in a
    pattern?</p>

    <p>When you hold your community meetings, try to arrange for
    community members to talk about how they are using the
    project's technology. Use these opportunities to learn about
    the people who have come to your technology on their own. And
    learn about what they are doing with it.</p>

    <p>Get your developers together periodically to share what's
    been learned and brainstorm new opportunities. Have a variety
    of people in your company look at the community. When you think
    you have something, it might turn out that some community
    members your community manager is friendly with are willing to
    discuss your ideas.</p>

    <p>The key is just to keep your eyes open--don't pry and don't
    do official-looking surveys. Simply be aware of what your
    community is up to, who is in it, and what they share
    voluntarily about what they are doing and the problems they're
    having.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="welcome-the-unexpected">
    <h2>Welcome the Unexpected</h2>

    <p>One of the strengths of open source is that contributors
    always surprise you. When someone submits a new module that
    takes things in a new direction, be willing to devote some
    resources to making it a bigger success. If some people start
    using your product in ways you didn't expect, check it out and
    see whether there's a whole new market waiting for you. Most of
    all, listen to what your community tells you it wants and
    needs. You have made an investment of company resources in
    order to use open source, so be sure to get the greatest
    possibe return on that investment by harvesting the innovation
    that your community creates.</p>
