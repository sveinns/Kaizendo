# TODO

There's plenty of things to do! 

If you want to help, here are a few pointers...

# App::Kaizendo

Set up a REST interface according to the current spec, found on

* Set up the commenting REST API
* Set up core features
   * Show a chapter
   * List chapters
   * Show a chapter aspect
   * List chapter aspects
   * Show comments related to a chapter aspect page
* Create templates

# Tests

The app needs tests for all kinds of usage scenarios. Check out the
code from Github and add your tests to the t/ dir. Testing the REST
interface is part of this!

* Create, read, update, rename and delete
   * Projects
   * Chapters
   * Aspects
* Create and read comments
* Comment invalidation and migration

# Content

We're looking for good example texts to use! If you know of any,
then please add them to your own github clone of the project and
send a pull request.

Currently, we have one example text in the books/ directory, where
we'd like the following improvements:

* Clean up the HTML so that it's valid and well-formed HTML5 (or an HTML4.2, if necessary)
* Organize the book so that it becomes one file per chapter
* Set up the HTML files so that they easily can be converted into Template::Toolkit templates.

# Stories and use cases

We're also looking for creative and novel usage stories. What would you
do with an authoring tool that supports aspects? Tell us!

# How to help

First of all, you should know that we're a really friendly bunch, and that
we'd love to have your help and support! :)

If you'd like to help the project succeed, tell us! Join the kaizendoers 
mailing list, and send us a mail with your thoughts.
