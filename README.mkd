# ABOUT

Kaizendo is about creating collaboratively authored polyscopic documents.

The goal is a web service that allows the management and creation of texts
with "_aspects_", where each aspect is an alternative of the text that
conveys the same message as the "original" text, but in a different way.

E.g. a textbook with chapters that have alternative texts written for
dyslectics, for fast readers and for "average" readers.

To write such a text is a difficult and time-consuming task, especially
when you want to support combinations of aspects while keeping a coherent
narrative and language use across chapters and aspects.

We want to make it possible (and perhaps even easy) to write these texts
anyway.

# TESTING

To test the application, install any dependencies and run the unit tests
as usual, and finally start the demo webserver:

 perl Makefile.PL      # or run "cpan ." if you have it set up
 make
 make test             # generates test database

 scripts/kaizendo_server.pl -d   # start server in debug mode

And then point your browser to the URL mentioned at the last step.

Running the test suite creates a database that you can browse, so you have
to run it at least once.

# DEBUGGING

Debugging can be turned on by running the tests as above, and then firing up
the server as follows:

  script/kaizendo_server.pl -d -r
